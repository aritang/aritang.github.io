      - say i don't know what i'll do without you in my life. it'd be so sour.
      - i'm hoping that everybody can experience, what we have in ours
      - hey, what happened to the butterflies?
      - imagine a world like that.
      - hey, right when i think that we've found it, but that's when we start turnin' around. 
      - you're saying that baby don't worry, but we're still going the wrong way.
      - so i'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands. it's about you! you... only you.
      - excuse me, i love u.
      - i'm under pressure 'cause i can't have u the way that i want. let's just go back to the way it was, when we were on honeymoon avenue.
