    Content:
      - you know me better than i do.*
      - hey, what happened to the butterflies?
      # - imagine a world like that.
      - say it's tricky at the top,*
        gotta have a slim ego for a thick wallet.
      - if i were you, i'd wanna be me too.*
      - i don't know what i'll do without you in my life*
        it'd be so sour*
        i'm hopin' that everybody can experience what we have in ours*
      - treat my goals like properties*
        collect them like monopoly
      - craziness with discipline.
      - it's not like i'd ever change a thing* 
        cause i'm right here where i meant to be.
