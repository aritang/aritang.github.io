    Content:
      - i'm over here doing what i like,*
        i'm over here working day and night.*
        if my real ain't real enough,*
        i don't know what is.
        # - say i don't know what i'll do without you in my life.* 
        # it'd be so sour.*
        # i'm hoping that everybody can experience, what we have in ours.*
      - hey, what happened to the butterflies?
      - imagine a world like that.
      - couldn't ever imagine even having doubt,* 
        but, not everything works out.
        # - down like six thirty (yuh), down like sunset (hmm)
      - say it's tricky at the top,*
        gotta have a slim ego for a thick wallet.
