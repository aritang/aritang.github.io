    Content:
      - say i don't know what i'll do without you in my life. it'd be so sour. i'm hoping that everybody can experience, what we have in ours.
      - hey, what happened to the butterflies?
      - imagine a world like that.
        # - hey, right when i think that we've found it, but that's when we start turnin' around. you're saying that baby don't worry, but we're still going the wrong way.
        # - i'm a princess to the public but a freak when it's time
      - couldn't ever imagine even having doubt, but not everything works out.
        # - down like six thirty (yuh), down like sunset (hmm)
      - say it's tricky at the top, gotta have a slim ego for a thick wallet.
