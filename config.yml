    Title: "a blog about research, art and life"
    Content:
      - i'm over here doing what i like,*
        i'm over here working day and night.*
        if my real ain't real enough,*
        i don't know what is.
        # - say i don't know what i'll do without you in my life.* 
        # it'd be so sour.*
        # i'm hoping that everybody can experience, what we have in ours.*
      - hey, what happened to the butterflies?
      - imagine a world like that.
        # - couldn't ever imagine even having doubt,* 
        # but, not everything works out.
        # - down like six thirty (yuh), down like sunset (hmm)
      - say it's tricky at the top,*
        gotta have a slim ego for a thick wallet.
      - if i were you, i'd wanna be me too.*
        #      - so long as i live, i love u, will have and hold you.*
        #you look so beautiful in white.*
        #what we have is timeless, my love is endless.*
        #with all my heart, i mean every word.
      - say i don't know what i'll do without u in my life, but it'd be so sour.*
        i'm hopin that everybody can experience what we have in ours.*
      - treat my goals like properties*
        collect them like monopoly
