      <description>&lt;p&gt;When opportunity comes, say, when you find yourself sharing an elevator with a Nobel Prize winner in your field, with just a few floors left to impress them. It&amp;rsquo;s sales pitch in academic–to impress people using a concise, compelling summary that highlights the brilliance and relevance of your work. It&amp;rsquo;s your chance to leave them thinking, &amp;ldquo;Wow, I need to know more about this!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my journey, I often find myself needing to explain kidney exchange to introduce people to market design—my dream field. However, I sometimes struggle with organizing my language or recalling precise facts. Therefore, in the coming days, I will be doing a literature and fact review on kidney exchange and general transplantation. Stay tuned for more insights!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
