      <description>&lt;p&gt;The maternity care units in both the United States and China are facing a dilemma that threatens the very foundation of obstetric services. This crisis, while nuanced in its manifestation in each country, shares a common thread of financial strain, staffing challenges, and misaligned incentives that put the future of maternity care at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Struggle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the situation is particularly dire in rural areas, where more than 200 hospitals have closed their labor and delivery services over the past decade. This trend leaves pregnant individuals in these regions more vulnerable, with higher risks of intensive care unit admission, mortality, and infant mortality. The absence of local maternity care services means that many patients are unable to obtain adequate prenatal or postpartum care, a necessity for ensuring healthy outcomes for both mother and child.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
