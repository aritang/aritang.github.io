      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I found myself reluctant to admit my attachment to mainstream pop, my favourite album over the summer of 2024 would have to be &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short N&amp;rsquo; Sweet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;—given the unhealthy playing repeats of a few of its singles. Here are two reviews explaining why it might just be the biggest hit of 2024:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Meeting of Titans – The Day Vladimir Horowitz and Sergei Rachmaninoff Arrived Together at Steinway Hall</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steinway-piano dot com has the story of the meeting of the two perhaps most influential musicians among the piano community of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;horowitz-the-rising-of-a-star&#34;&gt;Horowitz: the rising of a star&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Horowitz and Sergei Rachmaninoff had each suffered great losses in the Russian Revolution of 1917. “We lost absolutely everything,” Horowitz told author, radio personality, and Steinway Artist David Dubal, as reported in Dubal’s book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books/about/Reflections_from_the_keyboard.html?id=VfgXAQAAIAAJ&#34;&gt;Reflections from the Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “In 24 hours, all we had we lost.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zen and Art of Piano | Horowitz</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/zen_and_art_of_piano/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Horowitz, fire sings through metal, glass, water and &lt;em&gt;ice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carolina Philharmonic has the story &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Zen and the Art of Piano | Vladimir Horowitz&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, by David Michael Wolff. It&amp;rsquo;s about the artistic style of &lt;strong&gt;pianist Horowitz&lt;/strong&gt; and his inspirational friendship with Rachmaninoff. The time was around the beginning of the 20th century—artists flee from the war and revolution in Russia to arrive in US:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young Horowitz had just landed off the boat in NYC and with all the sights the New World had to offer, his first stop was Rachmaninoff’s Manhattan apartment. The next day they met at the now famed basement of Steinway Hall so that Rachmaninoff could hear what the young artist could do with his colossal Third Concerto. They played through the entire work at two pianos. Can you imagine what that must have sounded like - these twin giants of 20th century pianism - their languages blending and playing off each other!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Andante Cantabile II</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andante Cantabile, generally means &amp;ldquo;singing and walking&amp;rdquo;, is a musical &lt;em&gt;term&lt;/em&gt;—a descriptive marker atop a score to delineate the mood or tempo intended by the composer. It . This trend is particularly poignant in compositions of grand scale, where each movement, each phrase, carries its own distinct &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the luminaries of the Andante Cantabile, Tchaikovsky’s String Quartet No. 1 in D Major resonates profoundly, a masterpiece that I&amp;rsquo;ve previously explored in &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;an older post&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, even this pales in comparison to what may be the zenith of this expression:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>eclipsed revelation - crafting eternal sunshine in keystrokes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ariana Grande possesses a magnetic energy that attracts literally everything–from musical excellence to (possibly undesired) publicity. Among her songs, &amp;ldquo;just like magic&amp;rdquo; stands out as a testament to awe-inspiring confidence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like magic, I&amp;rsquo;m attractive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get everything I want cause I attract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a fine line between positive self-assurance and complacency. With her four-octave range and Mariah Carey-like whistle note capacity, Ariana Grande has never lacked a &amp;ldquo;hear-me-roar&amp;rdquo; attitude, reminiscent of &amp;rsquo;90s divas. She has consistently showcased an unshakable belief in herself, as heard in &amp;ldquo;Dangerous Woman&amp;rdquo;—&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t need permission, made my decision, to test my limits,&amp;rdquo; and the resplendent &amp;ldquo;7 rings&amp;rdquo;—&amp;ldquo;I want it, I got it.&amp;rdquo; Early on, she was often described as &amp;ldquo;a small woman with a big voice and a huge personality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;means i wanna sixty-nine with yu, no&amp;hellip;shit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(mumbling) math class, never was good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– 34+35, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living under possibly the most draconian public scrutiny, Ariana Grande steered through the tumulous years of her rising music career accompanied by a terrorist attack during tour, several relationship melt downs, meanwhile delivered two of the best albums—and one of the highest-grossing tours—of 2018 and 2019. That she might finally be experiencing some release, which is what her return album in 2020 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; sound like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank U, Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; got two seats out of the top-10 list. One is &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/posts/imagine/&#34;&gt;imagine&lt;/a&gt;, the other is &lt;strong&gt;needy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hate overly simple songs: cloying melodies consisted of banal, unimaginative motifs  and too-obvious intentions are absolutely unforgivable. Referring the words of a professor&amp;rsquo;s architecture appreciation course I&amp;rsquo;ve taken two years ago, &amp;ldquo;sometimes overly obvious &amp;lsquo;signs&amp;rsquo; or too straightforward expressions, despite appealing, are degrading for art.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT &amp;mdash;- despite having shallow melodies (that one can literally anticipate the whole song after hearing the first few bars), needy sits on top of the list being simplicitly expressive and truthful. The song is about insecurities–of one&amp;rsquo;s attachment, obsession and struggle in a relationship–that Ariana Grande sang out in subjective tense, right out of the lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the opening track of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s tumultuous album &lt;em&gt;Thank U, Next&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;imagine&amp;rdquo; sets the tone with mesmerizing minimalism. Listen &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/7_rftpd0u0U?si=8fAYMCzbEAuH2LYD&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This official music video of imagine features mosaiced icebergs melting to fall. The song gives an impression of a breathtakingly beautiful abstract painting, when one looks more carefully, there is so much pain tangled within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an absolute masterpiece that particularly, adds depth to the album&amp;rsquo;s artistry. It employs a steady triple meter and firm beats to elegantly propel the flow forward. The pre-chorus builds momentum with a gentle crescendo and chord progression. In the chorus, following the lyric &amp;ldquo;imagine a world like that,&amp;rdquo; which Ariana sings with extreme fortissimo and strength, the song falls into silence as if the question remains unanswered. It embodies &amp;ldquo;a simple, beautiful love that is now (and forever) unattainable,&amp;rdquo; serving as an unresolved plea for a fragmented, unrealistic dream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;get well soon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/hXU4P6j3TNY?si=XIj_rbNIYPA1yGtv&#34;&gt;YouTube for the official audio release&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ac411M7ty/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&amp;amp;vd_source=047f1e1eeb7e14e77db36bbee08c35e5&#34;&gt;the unreleased vide available on Bilibili&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get well soon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (stylized in all lowercase) is the fifteenth and final track from &lt;a href=&#34;https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Ariana_Grande&#34;&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s fourth studio album, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Sweetener_(album)&#34;&gt;Sweetener&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The track is 5 minutes and 22 seconds long, paying respect to the Manchester bombing attack at Ariana’s concert on the 22nd of May 2017. There&amp;rsquo;s 40 seconds of silence at the end of the track, to commemorate those who lost their lives during the attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the musical Hamilton (2015), in the song Satisfied, the rap verse, Angelica sang three reasons, literally &amp;ldquo;number one/two/three, &amp;hellip;blah blah&amp;rdquo; to illustrate why she loved but cannot marry Alexander Hamilton and she backed up for her sister. It was possibly the most unimaginatively boring lyrics ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, when it comes to music, aside from serious discuss of production quality, vocal techniques or more general analysis, sometimes what matters most is appeals and feelings. There are basically two kinds of &amp;lsquo;favourite&amp;rsquo; for a song. One is that you are able to name numerous reasons, that the song is an artistic marvel, topping the chart, being experimental etc.. Another version of favourite is that some song somehow becomes the go-to song on top of one&amp;rsquo;s mind. When I was picking out the top-k songs, compared to the ones that swing around the borderline that it takes a minute to decide whether it falls above or below the threshold, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goodnight n go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was picked directly out of the pool and stuffed into the second place among my all-time favourites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The title track of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s fourth studio album &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;sweetener&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (stylized in all lowercase) the pivotal nomination in my top-10 Ariana Grande list. This album, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweetener&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, won Grande a Grammy. The artist herself has elucidated the essence of the album&amp;rsquo;s title, suggesting it&amp;rsquo;s an ode to the act of illuminating one&amp;rsquo;s existence or circumstances, metaphorically &amp;ldquo;sweetening&amp;rdquo; life&amp;rsquo;s myriad challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone&amp;rsquo;s life or somebody else brings light to your life. Sweetening the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus is an Ariana Grande single yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to any of her studio albums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song was originally released as the lead single from Grande&amp;rsquo;s third studio album, titled &lt;em&gt;Moonlight&lt;/em&gt; at the time. As the album&amp;rsquo;s concept changed and its title renamed to become &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Dangerous_Woman_(album)&#34;&gt;Dangerous Woman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the song was removed from the main track list, including the standard and deluxe versions. In this process, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Dangerous_Woman_(song)&#34;&gt;Dangerous Woman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; replaced &amp;ldquo;Focus&amp;rdquo; as the lead single.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two songs from Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s debut album &lt;em&gt;Yours Truly&lt;/em&gt; hold a special place in my heart, and they&amp;rsquo;ve earned their spots in my top 10 list. The first is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/posts/the_way/&#34;&gt;The Way&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, and the other is &amp;ldquo;Tattooed Heart&amp;rdquo;. While &amp;ldquo;The Way&amp;rdquo; was an immediate hit upon release, &amp;ldquo;Tattooed Heart&amp;rdquo; gained recognition more gradually, especially after Grande performed it frequently in her later career, notably during her Sweetener World Tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setlist of the Sweetener World Tour was strategically divided into three sections. The first section featured upbeat, fast-tempo hits perfect for stage performances, such as &amp;ldquo;God Is A Woman&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;break up with your girlfriend, i&amp;rsquo;m bored.&amp;rdquo; The second section transitioned into a more intimate and emotional chapter, showcasing songs like &amp;ldquo;needy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sweetener,&amp;rdquo; and culminating with &amp;ldquo;Tattooed Heart.&amp;rdquo; During this performance, Grande sang at the center of the venue, beneath an artificial moon, creating a captivating atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The countdown is on: just ten days until the release of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s seventh album, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal Sunshine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. As a tribute to my favorite artist&amp;rsquo;s new musical chapter and to alleviate the recent turmoil of work, I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating a ten-day series on my blog to my top ten personal Ariana Grande songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My musical preferences have subtly evolved over time. Songs that once seemed mundane or whose acclaim puzzled me have, with time, revealed their allure. This transformation echoes a perspective shared by a friend: &amp;ldquo;If a celebrated work&amp;rsquo;s acclaim seems unwarranted, it&amp;rsquo;s likely you were not its intended audience—at least, not yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is YuanXiao Festival, the first full moon of the year of the Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I saw the moonlight today. What reason should I make up so as to bring it to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/denGNWMNsSY?si=iNxM1PMFdy1sHoYZ&#34;&gt;Moonlight&lt;/a&gt; by Ariana Grande from her third album Dangerous Woman. It&amp;rsquo;s just an elegant, gorgeous love ballad. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Moonlight#Background_and_recording&#34;&gt;Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s Wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Mon%C3%A9t&#34;&gt;Victoria Monét&lt;/a&gt; (Grande&amp;rsquo;s producer-slash-bestie) said &amp;ldquo;[&amp;lsquo;Moonlight&amp;rsquo;,] that’s what &lt;a href=&#34;https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Ricky_Alvarez&#34;&gt;Ricky&lt;/a&gt; [Alvarez, Grande&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend then] called her one night. I think it was after their first kiss. He waited to kiss her for a long time, and she was really impressed. He’s such a gentleman, and the song is a great little bookmark of the start of their relationship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know that all the shits&amp;rsquo; fabricated&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– breathin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;breathin,&amp;rdquo; the ninth track from her 2018 album &lt;em&gt;Sweetener&lt;/em&gt;, stands as a quintessential pop anthem. Despite its conventional ABABCB song structure and the use of familiar chord progressions and motifs, the track has resonated deeply with a broad audience, many of whom regard it as a highlight of the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the song&amp;rsquo;s pop sensibilities might seem overly straightforward to some, its lyrical depth and the uplifting nature of its theme offer a surprising layer of relatability. Ariana Grande herself described &amp;ldquo;breathin&amp;rdquo; as an intimate reflection on her personal struggles with anxiety. I was surprised at how reflective it is just to feel being seen out of a vexed situation. This aspect of the song has, on occasion, provided me with a sense of encouragement during moments of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secret Mathematical Patterns Revealed in Bach’s Music</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Music exists at the sublime confluence of mathematics and artistry, embodying a synergy that elevates both disciplines. The essence of music theory, particularly in the analysis of chords, mirrors an advanced form of modular arithmetic, showcasing a mathematical elegance. Musical scores serve as encoded scripts of melodies, awaiting decryption and performance. Particularly, Johann Sebastian Bach epitomizes this blend of mathematical intricacy and artistic beauty, standing as a paragon of the fusion between the two realms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sabrina Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s hit &lt;em&gt;Nonsense&lt;/em&gt; is a great song, both artistically and commercially. The song gives a &amp;ldquo;I-DONT-GIVE-A-SHIT&amp;rdquo; (IDGAS) energy. The singer herself said in Genius VERIFIED interview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;we were hitting a lot of walls and we&amp;rsquo;re like, you know what, let&amp;rsquo;s just literally write nonsense, no joke. and that&amp;rsquo;s how the song happened.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A lot of our justification for lyrics was well it&amp;rsquo;s nonsense. so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to make any sense at all and we just have fun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
