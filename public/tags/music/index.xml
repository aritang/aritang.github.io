      <title>eclipsed revelation - crafting eternal sunshine in keystrokes</title>

      <description>Inspired by the aesthetic of eternal sunshine&amp;rsquo;s album cover, I customized a Typora themeable that echos the album&amp;rsquo;s concept.
the red of the gloves, paired with the innocent white dress, echoes a juxtaposition of passion and purity. meanwhile The dark background augments the sense of mesmerizing self-revelation.
Instead of directly replicating the color palette from the album cover, I decided to take a more conceptual approach, in reflecting the commitment to an ethereal minimalism—like, an homage to the what Saturn Return brings into our lives.</description>

      <description>Ariana Grande possesses a magnetic energy that attracts literally everything–from musical excellence to (possibly undesired) publicity. Among her songs, &amp;ldquo;just like magic&amp;rdquo; stands out as a testament to awe-inspiring confidence:
Just like magic, I&amp;rsquo;m attractive
I get everything I want cause I attract them.
There&amp;rsquo;s a fine line between positive self-assurance and complacency. With her four-octave range and Mariah Carey-like whistle note capacity, Ariana Grande has never lacked a &amp;ldquo;hear-me-roar&amp;rdquo; attitude, reminiscent of &amp;rsquo;90s divas.</description>

      <description>means i wanna sixty-nine with yu, no&amp;hellip;shit
(mumbling) math class, never was good
– 34+35, Positions
Living under possibly the most draconian public scrutiny, Ariana Grande steered through the tumulous years of her rising music career accompanied by a terrorist attack during tour, several relationship melt downs, meanwhile delivered two of the best albums—and one of the highest-grossing tours—of 2018 and 2019. That she might finally be experiencing some release, which is what her return album in 2020 Positions sound like.</description>

      <description>Thank U, Next got two seats out of the top-10 list. One is imagine, the other is needy.
I do hate overly simple songs: cloying melodies consisted of banal, unimaginative motifs and too-obvious intentions are absolutely unforgivable. Referring the words of a professor&amp;rsquo;s architecture appreciation course I&amp;rsquo;ve taken two years ago, &amp;ldquo;sometimes overly obvious &amp;lsquo;signs&amp;rsquo; or too straightforward expressions, despite appealing, are degrading for art.&amp;rdquo;
BUT &amp;mdash;- despite having shallow melodies (that one can literally anticipate the whole song after hearing the first few bars), needy sits on top of the list being simplicitly expressive and truthful.</description>

      <description>As the opening track of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s tumultuous album Thank U, Next, &amp;ldquo;imagine&amp;rdquo; sets the tone with mesmerizing minimalism. Listen here. This official music video of imagine features mosaiced icebergs melting to fall. The song gives an impression of a breathtakingly beautiful abstract painting, when one looks more carefully, there is so much pain tangled within.
Imagine is an absolute masterpiece that particularly, adds depth to the album&amp;rsquo;s artistry. It employs a steady triple meter and firm beats to elegantly propel the flow forward.</description>

      <description>Listen to get well soon on YouTube for the official audio release or the unreleased vide available on Bilibili)
Get well soon (stylized in all lowercase) is the fifteenth and final track from Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s fourth studio album, Sweetener. The track is 5 minutes and 22 seconds long, paying respect to the Manchester bombing attack at Ariana’s concert on the 22nd of May 2017. There&amp;rsquo;s 40 seconds of silence at the end of the track, to commemorate those who lost their lives during the attack.</description>

      <description>In the musical Hamilton (2015), in the song Satisfied, the rap verse, Angelica sang three reasons, literally &amp;ldquo;number one/two/three, &amp;hellip;blah blah&amp;rdquo; to illustrate why she loved but cannot marry Alexander Hamilton and she backed up for her sister. It was possibly the most unimaginatively boring lyrics ever written.
That is to say, when it comes to music, aside from serious discuss of production quality, vocal techniques or more general analysis, sometimes what matters most is appeals and feelings.</description>

      <description>Listen here: Ariana Grande, “Sweetener”
The title track of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s fourth studio album &amp;ldquo;sweetener&amp;rdquo; (stylized in all lowercase) the pivotal nomination in my top-10 Ariana Grande list. This album, Sweetener, won Grande a Grammy. The artist herself has elucidated the essence of the album&amp;rsquo;s title, suggesting it&amp;rsquo;s an ode to the act of illuminating one&amp;rsquo;s existence or circumstances, metaphorically &amp;ldquo;sweetening&amp;rdquo; life&amp;rsquo;s myriad challenges:
it&amp;rsquo;s kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone&amp;rsquo;s life or somebody else brings light to your life.</description>

      <description>One, two three&amp;hellip; c&amp;rsquo;om, girls!
Focus is an Ariana Grande single yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to any of her studio albums:
The song was originally released as the lead single from Grande&amp;rsquo;s third studio album, titled Moonlight at the time. As the album&amp;rsquo;s concept changed and its title renamed to become Dangerous Woman, the song was removed from the main track list, including the standard and deluxe versions. In this process, &amp;ldquo;Dangerous Woman&amp;rdquo; replaced &amp;ldquo;Focus&amp;rdquo; as the lead single.</description>

      <description>Two songs from Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s debut album Yours Truly hold a special place in my heart, and they&amp;rsquo;ve earned their spots in my top 10 list. The first is &amp;ldquo;The Way&amp;rdquo;, and the other is &amp;ldquo;Tattooed Heart&amp;rdquo;. While &amp;ldquo;The Way&amp;rdquo; was an immediate hit upon release, &amp;ldquo;Tattooed Heart&amp;rdquo; gained recognition more gradually, especially after Grande performed it frequently in her later career, notably during her Sweetener World Tour.
The setlist of the Sweetener World Tour was strategically divided into three sections.</description>

      <description>The countdown is on: just ten days until the release of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s seventh album, Eternal Sunshine. As a tribute to my favorite artist&amp;rsquo;s new musical chapter and to alleviate the recent turmoil of work, I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating a ten-day series on my blog to my top ten personal Ariana Grande songs.
My musical preferences have subtly evolved over time. Songs that once seemed mundane or whose acclaim puzzled me have, with time, revealed their allure.</description>

      <description>Today is YuanXiao Festival, the first full moon of the year of the Dragon.
&amp;ldquo;I saw the moonlight today. What reason should I make up so as to bring it to you?&amp;rdquo;
It reminded me of Moonlight by Ariana Grande from her third album Dangerous Woman. It&amp;rsquo;s just an elegant, gorgeous love ballad. According to Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s Wiki:
Victoria Monét (Grande&amp;rsquo;s producer-slash-bestie) said &amp;ldquo;[&amp;lsquo;Moonlight&amp;rsquo;,] that’s what Ricky [Alvarez, Grande&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend then] called her one night.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I know that all the shits&amp;rsquo; fabricated&amp;rdquo;
– breathin
Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;breathin,&amp;rdquo; the ninth track from her 2018 album Sweetener, stands as a quintessential pop anthem. Despite its conventional ABABCB song structure and the use of familiar chord progressions and motifs, the track has resonated deeply with a broad audience, many of whom regard it as a highlight of the album.
While the song&amp;rsquo;s pop sensibilities might seem overly straightforward to some, its lyrical depth and the uplifting nature of its theme offer a surprising layer of relatability.</description>

      <title>Secret Mathematical Patterns Revealed in Bach’s Music</title>

      <description>Music exists at the sublime confluence of mathematics and artistry, embodying a synergy that elevates both disciplines. The essence of music theory, particularly in the analysis of chords, mirrors an advanced form of modular arithmetic, showcasing a mathematical elegance. Musical scores serve as encoded scripts of melodies, awaiting decryption and performance. Particularly, Johann Sebastian Bach epitomizes this blend of mathematical intricacy and artistic beauty, standing as a paragon of the fusion between the two realms.</description>

      <description>Sabrina Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s hit Nonsense is a great song, both artistically and commercially. The song gives a &amp;ldquo;I-DONT-GIVE-A-SHIT&amp;rdquo; (IDGAS) energy. The singer herself said in Genius VERIFIED interview
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;we were hitting a lot of walls and we&amp;rsquo;re like, you know what, let&amp;rsquo;s just literally write nonsense, no joke. and that&amp;rsquo;s how the song happened.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;A lot of our justification for lyrics was well it&amp;rsquo;s nonsense. so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to make any sense at all and we just have fun.</description>
