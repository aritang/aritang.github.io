<p>Competition and information are two aspects of economics about which I think and write extensively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="/posts/antitrust_mega_tech_companies/">the paradox of modern connectivity and competition</a> –– about antitrust.</p>
<p><a href="/posts/blowing_in_the_wind/"><em>blowing in the wind</em></a> –– about delivery workers trapped in algorithms.</p>
<p>competition consequences: <a href="/posts/competitions_consequence/">I</a> and <a href="/posts/competitions_consequence1/">II</a> –– about competition.</p>
<p>I write notes about papers I read and talks I listened to. e.g. <a href="/posts/suspense_n_surprise/"><em>Suspense and Surprise</em></a>, by Jeffrey Ely, Alexander Framkel and Emir Kamenica.</p>

<p>I am a very artistically inclined person –– for <strong>fashion</strong> and <strong>music</strong>. Particularly, I write music comments whenever I&rsquo;m too busy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="/posts/grigory_sokolov/">the deceptive simplicity of Mozart&rsquo;s sonata facile, K.545</a></p>
<p>Ariana Grande&rsquo;s unreleased music: <a href="/posts/communicate/">who do we blame-for leaking AG&rsquo;s communicate</a></p>
<p>flute music: <a href="/posts/history_du_tango_1930/">tango between shadows and light | Histoire du Tango: II. Café 1930</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and occasionally, art and fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="/posts/once_upon_a_dream/">once upon a dream, in Met Gala</a> –– about Ariana Grande&rsquo;s performance at 2024 Met Gala, dressed in a breathtakingly beautiful Maison Margiela gown, designed by John Galliano.</p>
