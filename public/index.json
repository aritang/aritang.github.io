By Ilan Lobel, Jigar Patel, Gustavo Vulcano, and Jiawei Zhang.\nManagement Science 2016. DOI https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2189\nThe paper studies firm\u0026rsquo;s product launch policy. It is motivated by the industry example, where tech firms iteratively release new models of their products. For example, Apple releasing one new iPhone models almost every 12-18 months, or Nintendo\u0026rsquo;s upcoming switch 2 that has been overdued 7 years (still is though).\nA product launch is expensive because it involves operational costs and marketing campaigns etc. Consumers won\u0026rsquo;t buy in-a-row for a ridiculously rapid sucession. Oftentime, consumers strategically postpone their purchase decision to maximize their utility. The paper models a market of technology innovation and costly product launches, taking into account of consumer\u0026rsquo;s strategic forward-looking behavior, so as to study how firm should optimize their launch policy. Especially, whether to commit to a launch policy and when to launch new product.\ntechnicals The model is continuous time and build on the probabilistic tool of Bronian motions.\nA firm continually develops technology over time. The technology developed by the firm follows a stochastic process, which we assume to be a Brownian motion $Z(t) = \\mu t + \\sigma B(t)$.\nIt is assumed that technology level is public. At any time point, the firm can launch a new product that exactly corresponds to the current technology level $Z(t)$, and incurs fixed launch cost $K \u0026gt; 0$. Assume that only the latest product is available on the market.\nConsumer strategically buys. I.e. being aware of the firm\u0026rsquo;s policy, they buy at a certain timepoint iff. their anticipated utility of wait is less than that of buying the current available model now.\nFormallly, let the realized sample path til time $t$ be $w_t :={Z(s): 0\\le s \\le t}\\subset \\Omega_t$. Let $w:={Z(s): s\\in \\R_+}\\subset \\Omega$ denote the full sample path. Given a realized sample path, under certain firm\u0026rsquo;s strategy and corresponding consumer behavior, the transactions would be determined, and corresponding consumer utility can be computed: (taking integral over the sample path of consumer\u0026rsquo;s instant utility: $$ \\text{consumer\u0026rsquo;s utility: }U^c(w) = \\int_{t = 0}^\\infty C(t) e^{-\\delta t} \\ dt - p\\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty e^{-\\delta\\kappa_i} $$ where, $p$ is price, $\\kappa_i, i = 1, \\ldots$ is purchase time point, and $C(t)$ is a convenient symbol denoting the value that a certain consumer is holding at time point $t$.\nAnd, firm\u0026rsquo;s utility is available as well: $$ \\text{firm\u0026rsquo;s utility: }U^f(w) = (p - c - K)\\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty e^{-\\delta\\kappa_i} $$ (Remark: the model in the paper has a few more elements for generalization to heterogenous consumers).\nlaunching products on-the-go When firm does not make any commitment to the launching of product, the consumers and the firm would need to make decision based on thier beliefs about other\u0026rsquo;s behavior, and that they need to know the policy of the other party.\nOne way is to analyze Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), where the players make decision using Markovian strategies. Consider at time point $t$ and the state of the game $M(t)$, be the pair $(N(t), O(t))$ where $N(t)$ is upcoming tech value (market tech level $Z(t)$ minus currently available product\u0026rsquo;s tech level), and $O(t)$ is consumer\u0026rsquo;s outdated value (consumer\u0026rsquo;s holding value $C(t)$ minus tech level $Z(t)$.\nAt any time point, firm\u0026rsquo;s strategy would simply be a mapping $$ s^f :{M(t^-)}\\to {0, 1}\\ $$ to the decision space of whether to launch a product or not. Correspondingly, consumer\u0026rsquo;s policy would also be a mapping $$ s^c :{M(t^-)}\\to {0, 1} $$ into his purchase decision.\nThe author demonstrated the following claim as their first result (cf. Theorem 1 of the paper). Under this on-the-go strategy space, firm\u0026rsquo;s optimal launch strategy is a threshold policy: product launch iff. $N(t) = z^$ where $z^$ is the solution of $$ z(1 - e^{-\\Delta z}) = \\frac{p\\delta}v\\text{, where }\\Delta = \\frac{2\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\mu^2 + 2\\delta \\sigma^2} + \\mu}. $$\ncommitment The firm can do more when it is able to commit to technology levels of future launches. The firm announces an entire path of (discrete) technology levels of its products in advance, represented by $\\mathbf z$—and launch whenever technology level reaches the value. In other words, the $i$th launch time would be exactly the time when tech level $Z(t)$ hit $i$th target level $z_i$.\nThen, consumer\u0026rsquo;s policy space at each time point $t$ would, in general, be a mapping $$ S^c_t : 2^{\\R_{+}}\\times \\Omega_t \\to {0, 1} \\text{ ($1$ for purchase)}. $$ (Btw, reminder: $\\Omega_t$ is the space of all possible sample paths til time point $t$, i.e. $w_t :={Z(s): 0\\le s \\le t}\\subset \\Omega_t$).\nDenote $S^c := {S_t^c}_t$ as the full strategy space over time.\nAnd finally, the firm\u0026rsquo;s decision presents as the following optimization: to maximize its expected utility subject to the consumer\u0026rsquo;s optimal response constraint: $$ \\begin{align*} \\max_{\\mathbf z \\in 2^{\\R_+}}\u0026amp;\\ \\mathbb E[U^f(\\mathbf z, s^c)]\\quad \\text{firm\u0026rsquo;s utility}\\cr \\text{s.t.}\u0026amp;\\ \\mathbb E[U^c(\\mathbf z, s^c_t) | \\omega _t]\\ge\\mathbb E[U^c(\\mathbf z, \\tilde s^c_t) | \\omega _t] \\forall t, \\omega_t \\in \\Omega_t, \\tilde s^c\\in S_t^c \\quad \\cr \u0026amp; \\ \\text{(consumer\u0026rsquo;s best response given }\\mathbf z) \\end{align*} $$ After observations, explains, lemmas, we land gracefully (really?) at Theorem 2 of the paper:\nTheorem 2 (Lobel et al., Theorem 2 part 2)\n(Under certain parameter conditions) the firm should launch new product generations in accordance with a 2-cycle policy with cycles $\\mathbf z := [r_1, r_2, r_1, r_2, \\ldots]$, where $$ r_1:p\\delta(e^{-\\Delta t} + 1 + \\Delta t) = 2v \\Delta t^2\\ r_2=\\frac1\\Delta \\log(\\frac{v r_1 }{vr_1 - p\\Delta}). $$\nand more For pricing, the paper further discussed the joint optimal launch-and-price policy—to endogenize the pricing decision but assume that a single price is chosen at $t = 0$. And via simulations, to demonstrate the value of commitment in various parameter settings. Lastly, the paper extends the model to heterogeneous consumers—with multiple consumer classes.\nThe framework introduced in this paper opens several new avenues for potential future work. One interesting direction is empirical: estimating long-term technology values of real products and matching these values to their launch policies would allow us to understand whether firms are currently successful in managing strategic customers. Extending our model to a competitive setting or to a setting with finite production capacity would also be important topics for future research.\n","permalink":"/posts/product_launch_brownian_motion/","summary":"Optimizing Product Launches in the Presence of Strategic Consumers.

This technical report explores the role of third-party cookies in the online advertising market, their inherent value, and the ongoing industry changes.\nSection 1 | What are Cookies? Definition: Cookies are small text files that hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular user and website. It is stored locally on a user\u0026rsquo;s computer.\nThe website specifies what data should be stored in the cookie, such as user ID, session keys, or preferences.\nThe browser\u0026rsquo;s role is to design protocals that manage cookies according to the request set by the website (i.e. Amazon: \u0026ldquo;Give me Jason\u0026rsquo;s every shopping records\u0026rdquo;) and the preferences configured by the user (Jason: \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; [browser: denying all 3rd party cookies]).\nTypes of Cookies: First-Party Cookies. Stored and used by the same webserver entity:\neg. NY Times stores user\u0026rsquo;s login info and language preference.\nThird-Party Cookies: The cookie is not being set by the news site directly (the first party), but by a separate entity (the third party):\neg. Google Ad Exchange places a cookie for future usage when one is reading on NY Times.\nExtras: Why cookies need to exist? Cookies store general information about user interactions with a website, allowing this data to be accessed in the future. This functionality is crucial because it compensates for what HTTP—our foundational web protocol—lacks.\nHTTP is inherently stateless, meaning that with each request (such as clicking the search button), the website does not inherently know who is making the request.\nTherefore, Cookies makes up for HTTP to keep information across time. And makes the following function available: session management, personalization (eg. language preference) and tracking.\nA straightforward explaination:\nImagine a website is like a hotel. The hotel wants each returning guest to have their room personalized to their requests each time they visit. They have millions of guests so instead of keeping a list of what everyone likes in a huge book, they write the guests requests on their foreheads. That way, there is no confusion and there is no need to identify everyone in a huge database. When a guest returns, they instantly know what they want without even asking.\nreddit user higgs8, 4y ago\n","permalink":"/posts/cookies_report/","summary":"In April 2024, Google announced the complete phase-out of third-party cookies by 2025, marking a significant shift in the digital landscape (timeline).

So someone might love you enough to give you a kidney if you needed one.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not so simple, someone could love you enough to give you a kidney, but you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to take their kidney. Even if they\u0026rsquo;re healthy enough to give someone a kidney, they might not be able to give it to you.\nSo sometimes there are these incompatible patient donor pairs—which means that there\u0026rsquo;s someone who loves you and wants to give you a kidney, but they can\u0026rsquo;t give it to you. And there might be someone who loves me and wants to give me a kidney, but can\u0026rsquo;t give it to me. But maybe my intended donor could give you a kidney and your intended donor could give me a kidney. And if we can arrange those exchanges, which is things that economists do, we could get more living donor transplants and save more lives.\nAnd this is where exchange happen. Economy people cares more about how potentially strategic patient donor pairs interact in this exchange market. Computer scientists are more concerned about how to design algorithms to make the market actually work.\nHolding the algorithmic tools in my hand while looking at these economic problems, a good market designer need to be sensitive to cultural and psychological factors to better understand the incentives and constraints that people face.

Held from July 1 to September 11, 2024, the conference covers a broad range of economic topics, with world-class scholars presenting leading-edge economic research.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost like \u0026ldquo;华山论剑\u0026rdquo; in Economics.\nOn July 2nd, Lise Vesterlund talked about non-promotable tasks (NPTs). It is a very interesting concept.\nwhat are non-promotable tasks? Non-promotable tasks are those that benefit the organization but likely don’t contribute to someone’s performance evaluation and career advancement. These tasks include traditional office “housework,” such as organizing a holiday party, as well as a much wider set of tasks, such as filling in for a colleague, serving on a low-ranking committee, or taking on routine work that doesn’t require much skill or produce much impact.\nWhat is non-promotable varies across fields and careers. For example, in industry, revenue-generating tasks are more promotable than non-revenue-generating tasks; in academia, research-related tasks are more promotable than service-related tasks; and for individuals, a task may be promotable for junior employees but non-promotable for senior-ranking managers.\n— Harvard Business Review, Why Women Volunteer for Tasks That Don’t Lead to Promotions (2018)\nAka, crap jobs. These jobs are usually not instrumental to an organization\u0026rsquo;s core mission and are often invisible to others (especially to leaders and bosses) and do not usually require specialized skills.\ngender inequality Unfortunately, sometimes employees, especially junior ones, are assigned or prompted to \u0026lsquo;voluntarily\u0026rsquo; take on NPTs without fully understanding their impact. They might think taking on some office housework is necessary before being assigned important tasks, or they might feel pressured by concerns about appearing unfriendly or guilty. But spending too much of one\u0026rsquo;s precious personal time on these tasks can be detrimental.\nThis problem is particularly pernicious for women. Studies show systematic gender differences in how work is allocated—women tend to spend more time than men on non-promotable tasks and less time on promotable ones. Lise and her co-authors have shown that:\nWe asked the management team at a professional services firm to rank work assignments by how promotable they were, and then examined how employees spent their time. We found that, independent of rank, the median female employee spent 200 more hours per year on non-promotable work than her male counterparts. To put that into perspective: Women spent an additional month on dead-end assignments.\nFurther, in a controlled setting where men and women were equally good at executing NPTs, we found that women were handling a greater number of them — not due to preference or attitude — but because they were expected to say yes more often. As a result, women were asked and volunteered to do NPTs frequently, while men got a free pass.\nIronically, when a group consisted only of men, they were substantially more willing to volunteer for NPTs compared to when women were present.\nwhat to do about it? Often, we feel pressured to say YES—even when we don’t have to. Some patterns for this include: feeling like we have to decide immediately, internalizing the expectation that we should say YES, or worse, being flattered by being asked, which nudges our vanity and pride in saying YES.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that we should say NO all the time. Instead, weigh an opportunity before taking on its responsibility. There is a cost to saying \u0026lsquo;NO\u0026rsquo;, but there is also the opportunity cost of saying \u0026lsquo;YES\u0026rsquo;. Set a \u0026lsquo;reserve price\u0026rsquo; for your time, and spend it on something more valuable.\nAlso, be aware of the intricate differences between tasks. Certainly, not all NPTs are the same. Since NPTs are almost unavoidable at times, it can be helpful to be intentional in choosing NPTs that are perhaps meaningful in certain ways—those that are consistent with our personal long-term aspirations. For example, some seemingly less-promotable tasks might be useful in developing essential skills, building connections we can leverage later, or simply being easier or more enjoyable.\nLastly, in a utilitarian way, weigh the urgency of the non-promotable task, and remember that you will always be busy in the future anyway, so don’t overload yourself with tasks. Why?\nA task with a short deadline will trump a task with a longer one, no matter how insignificant it is. Taking on too many NPTs with with short time horizons, however, will likely distract you from longer-term initiatives that are more valued by your organization.\na little more personal reflection I remember in high school, I had a classmate who volunteered to do a lot of NPTs. For high schoolers, NPTs ranged from taking care of plants to editing videos for class events. He could have spent his time doing something more interesting: hanging out with friends, taking photos, or simply studying more. The amount of time he volunteered for NPTs, as I observed, was far from productive and sub-optimal.\nWhat did he get in the end? He was praised by our class instructor at graduation—mentioned briefly in a speech. But the recognition he received was far less than he deserved. Essentially, he got nothing out of it apart from some mindless applause—I think he deserved better.\nWho is to blame?\nreference Kellogg Insight. \u0026ldquo;Are You Taking on Too Many Non-Promotable Tasks?\u0026rdquo; Harvard Business Review, April 27, 2022. https://hbr.org/2022/04/are-you-taking-on-too-many-non-promotable-tasks.\nBohns, Vanessa K. \u0026ldquo;Why Women Volunteer for Tasks That Don’t Lead to Promotions.\u0026rdquo; Harvard Business Review, July 16, 2018. https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions.\n","permalink":"/posts/non_promotable_tasks/","summary":"SITE 2024 (Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics) is happening!

These stimulants are often misused by students seeking to enhance their academic performance, particularly during exam periods. Some studies showing that up to 20% of college students may misuse these drugs at some point during their academic careers.\nThe problem is that, although amphetamines are prescriptive drugs, ADHD diagnosis is carried out by emphirical questionnaires rather than blood tests—which says, that students (and that they\u0026rsquo;re clever in the first place) can almost read the syndrome list for ADHD, fake some ADHD syndrome, and get a prescription from the doctor and buy it at any drug stores.\nThe misuse of amphetamines is associated with risks including dependency (of course), cardiovascular issues (because the drug causes blood vessels to contract), and mental health problems such as anxiety and psychosis. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make study efficient. Because the drug functions by making certain brain regions hyperactive, hence often the student taking amphetamines will have sleep issues.

It is omnipresent. Why does regulation exist? In a free-market economy, why does the government choose to place restrictions on the decisions of certain agents and actions?\nGeorge Stigler (1911-1991) introduced his \u0026ldquo;Theory of Economic Regulation\u0026rdquo; in 1971 trying to answer this question in a well-established framework, on the basis of some previous empirical arguments such as Normative Analysis as a Positive Theory (NPT) or Capture Theory (CT).\nwhen you see that a paper has over 16k citations and has 24 version—it\u0026rsquo;s the universe signaling READ IT.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what the paper is about:\nPreviously, it was criticized that sometimes regulations fail to address general public interest: for example, the gasoline import quota is bad for the national security and consumer surplus, and that it only benefits the oligopolies.\nSo many economists, for example, have denounced the ICC for its pro-railroad policies that this has become a cliche of the literature.\nStigler argues that this is natural in the first place—that regulations emerges because interest parties pushes their supported political representatives to promote them. The paper\u0026rsquo;s central thesis is that regulation is often sought by industries and designed primarily for their benefit, rather than for the public good.\nassumptions The regulatory authority has the power to coerce.\nAn interest group that can convince the regulatory authority to use its power of coercion for the benefit of that group can improve the group’s well-being.\nEconomic agents are utility maximizers:\ninterest groups attempt to enhance its well-being by securing favorable regulation from the authority that serves to redistribute wealth from others to the interest group.\nThe authority (or, the political systems) on the other hand, seeks financial and public support of the interest groups.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take democracy for granted—still, it is unreasonable to require every individual agents to vote over every regulatory decisions. But the democratic decision process must involve all the community, not simply the ones who are directly concerned with the particular regulatory issue (for example, a vegeterian citizen may still have to be involved in the decision of regulation over the consumption of horse meat in California). This impossibility requirement for efficiency is resolved by having numerous levels of government, quote the original paper:\nThe representative and his party are rewarded for their discovery and fulfillment of the political desires of their constituency by success in election and the perquisites of office.\nIf the representative denies ten large industries their special subsidies of money or governmental power, they will dedicate themselves to the election of a more complaisant successor: the stakes (well, their careers) are that important. This does not mean that every large industry can get what it wants or all that it wants: it does mean that the representative and his party must find a coalition of voter interests more durable than the anti-industry side of every industry policy proposal. A representative cannot win or keep office with the support of the sum of those who are opposed to: oil import quotas, farm subsidies, airport subsidies, hospital subsidies, unnecessary navy shipyards, an inequitable public housing program, and rural electrification subsidies.\nExcellent point! Mr. Stigler should be hired as the consultant writer for House of Cards.\nseveral ways industries seek benefits from the state: Direct Subsidies: While direct monetary subsidies are beneficial, industries often avoid them because they would need to be shared with new entrants, diluting the benefits. Control Over Entry: Industries prefer regulations that limit new competitors, such as import quotas or licensing requirements, which help maintain higher prices and profits. Influence on Substitutes and Complements: Industries lobby for policies that favor their products over substitutes and support complementary industries. Price-Fixing: Even industries with entry controls seek price regulation to ensure higher returns. in conclusion\u0026hellip; The paper emphasizes the rational behavior of political systems, where industries use the state\u0026rsquo;s coercive power to their advantage, often at the expense of broader societal interests.

This performing production is dedicated by the Frederick Ashton Foundation, with its original designs created by William Chappell, choreography done by Ashton, of course.\nBtw:\nWilliam Chappell (27 September 1907 – 1 January 1994) was a British dancer, ballet designer and director. He is most noted for his designs for more than 40 ballets or revues, including many of the early works of Sir Frederick Ashton and Dame Ninette de Valois.\nRoyal Ballet’s Founder Choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton (17 September 1904 – 18 August 1988) was a British ballet dancer and choreographer. Ashton is widely credited with the creation of a specifically English genre of ballet.\nLes Rendezvous was Ashton\u0026rsquo;s first substantial classical composition and an exultant statement of his idiosyncratic approach to academic ballet. It consists of a succession of light-hearted dances in a park where friends meet and socialize. Ashton\u0026rsquo;s choreographic skills shine through in the minute detail: the little glances and gestures, the pauses and the double takes which introduces to the individual characters, often provoking us into a heartful smile (Les Rendezvous, The Dream, Rhapsody. 2024, Royal Opera House, on Soundcloud.).\nThe Dream 🧚🏼🧚🏼🧚🏼 Frederick Ashton’s knitted the charm of Shakespeare and Mendelssohn’s gossamer-light music into The Dream—a ballet production of summer.\nTitania: “Out of this wood do not desire to go. Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no”\nAnd more fairies:\nMendelssohn is becoming Mariah Carey of June.\nRhapsody Rhapsody was created in 1980 and is one of Frederick Ashton’s final works. The ballet is set to Sergey Rachmaninoff’s well-known Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, which moves from stormy passages to calmer interludes.\nIt was created on acclaimed Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, who requested the Ashton commission and whose personality is at the heart of the work. The male Principal role is characterized by exceptionally fluent leaps, turns and lightness of movement. It is twinned with the strength and grace of the ballerina, a role created on the pure, fleet-footed style of former Royal Ballet Principal Lesley Collier.\nThe premiere of Rhapsody was given at the Royal Opera House in honour of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on the occasion of her 80th birthday.\n——more, from the official program website of the Royal Opera House.\n","permalink":"/posts/les_rendezvous/","summary":"June 18, The Royal Ballet presented three of Ashton\u0026rsquo;s most celebrated and expertly choreographed pieces set to music by Mendelssohn, Rachmaninoff and Auber.\nThis mixed programme opens with the buoyant Les Rendezvous, a fizzing succession of dances following a group of friends who meet in a park.

This adds an additional layer of complexity (hence, flexibility) to the problem and makes the model more versatile and interesting (according to another friend that I\u0026rsquo;ve talk to during the seminar).\nAs for online problems in general, for me personally, different kinds of online problems and their associated methodologies and mathematical tools has been quite enlightening yet overwhelming.

And, their analysis often involves intimidating, advanced mathematical tools. It requires both intuition and high-level math skills.\nI feel anxious about mastering these concepts, but I\u0026rsquo;m also looking forward to the online problem seminar course next semester.

The defender commits to a defensive strategy, and the attacker responds by choosing a target to attack. The outcome for both parties depends on their chosen actions and potentially some unknown world state.\nThere are $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$ possible targets. The defender has one unit of defensive effort to allocate among these targets, represented by a strategy vector: $$ \\mathbf p = [p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n] $$ where $ \\sum_i p_i = 1 $ and $ p_i \\in [0, 1] $. At every time point, after the defender chooses $\\mathbf p$, an attacker comes, knowing $\\mathcal p$, chooses a target $ i^* $ that maximizes his utility: $$ \\text{(attacker\u0026rsquo;s utility) } U^\\text a = \\max_{\\mathbf y} \\sum_{i\\in [n]}y_i\\left( p_iu^1_i + (1 - p_i)u^0_i\\right)\\ \\text{later we\u0026rsquo;ll see, it\u0026rsquo;s type-dependent} $$ Here, $ u_i^1 $ and $ u_i^0 $ are the attacker\u0026rsquo;s utilities from attacking target $i$ when it is protected and unprotected, respectively. The attacker\u0026rsquo;s action vector $ \\mathbf y \\in {0, 1}^n $. The optimal attack response to the defender\u0026rsquo;s strategy $ \\mathbf p $ is: $$ \\mathbf y^:=\\arg\\max_{\\mathbf y}\\sum_{i\\in [n]}y_i\\left( p_iu^1_i + (1 - p_i)u^0_i\\right) $$ Given the attacker\u0026rsquo;s best response $ \\mathbf y^(\\mathbf p) $, the defender\u0026rsquo;s utility is: $$ \\text{(defender\u0026rsquo;s utility) } U^\\text d (\\mathbf p) = \\sum_{i \\in [n]} \\left( y^_i (v^1_i p_i + v^0_i (1 - p_i)) + (1 - y^_i)(\\bar v_i^1 p_i + \\bar v_i (1 - p_i)) \\right) $$ From my memory of the talk, the model is linear in both players\u0026rsquo; strategies. However, the paper uses more general notations and definitions, but the results rely heavily on a polytope-linear partition of the defender\u0026rsquo;s action space, so the linear assumption should be quite general.\nno-regret Taking the defender\u0026rsquo;s perspective in a dynamic setting, at each time point $ t = 1, 2, \\ldots, T $, nature selects an attacker $ A_{k_t} $ from a set of $ K $ possible attackers, with different utility functions and attacking habits. The defender knows the utilities but not the upcoming attacker\u0026rsquo;s type before committing to a strategy $ \\mathbf p^t $.\nThe regret is defined as: $$ \\text{(regret) }R(T) = \\tilde U^d(\\mathbf {\\tilde {p^t}})-\\sum_{t = 1}^T U^d(\\mathbf p^t) $$ where $ \\tilde U^d $ is the optimal-in-hindsight benchmark.\nNo-regret benchmark:\nThe optimal-in-hindsight benchmark $\\tilde U^d$ is defined for optimized strategy knowning the upcoming chosen sequence ${A_{k_1}, \\ldots, A_{k_T}}$. But, the attacker\u0026rsquo;s action at each time point still changes given the defender\u0026rsquo;s strategy changes.\nWhen the set of attackers is fixed and finite, no-regret learning (where $ R(T) = o(T) $) is achievable.

While algorithms for computing an optimal strategy for the defender to commit to have been used in several real-world applications, deployed applications require knowledge about the utility function of the potential attacker. In this talk I will describe an online learning approach for addressing this problem. We consider algorithms that prescribe a randomized strategy for the defender at each step against an adversarially chosen sequence of attackers and obtain feedback on their choices. I will discuss online algorithms whose regret (when compared to the best fixed strategy in hindsight) is sublinear in the number of time steps.

As of 2024, they are the five European leaders in size and popularity of the main domestic football leagues – the Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 respectively in men\u0026rsquo;s football.\nEngland (Premier League), Spain (La Liga), Italy (Serie A), Germany (Bundesliga) and France (Ligue 1)\nOn January 1, 2024, the winter transfer window for the 23/24 season in European football opened as usual. For the ongoing European club competitions spanning the New Year, this is the only opportunity within the season to make significant adjustments to the squads. During the 2023 winter transfer window, teams from the top five leagues spent a total of 1.061 billion euros.\nSpecifically, the football transfer window refers to a specific period during which clubs can sign new players or sell existing players. Generally, it is divided into the summer transfer window and the winter transfer window, abbreviated as \u0026ldquo;summer window\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;winter window,\u0026rdquo; respectively. During the transfer window, there are usually two ways to trade players: permanent transfers and loans. A permanent transfer means that a player leaves their original club and signs a contract with a new club. In contrast, a loan refers to one club temporarily lending its player to another club. During the loan period, the player remains registered with their original club and will return to the original club once the loan period ends.\nthe trend In the past decade, one major trend in European football has been the corporatization of football clubs. This is specifically manifested by multinational companies owning and managing multiple football clubs worldwide. Through corporatization, these clubs can maximize resource sharing and coordinated development, thereby enhancing their overall strength and achieving commercial success in the football field.\nCurrently, the two largest football conglomerates are the City Football Group (CFG) and the Red Bull Group. The former is controlled by the Abu Dhabi United Group, headquartered in Manchester, England, and owns several football clubs, including the Premier League\u0026rsquo;s Manchester City, La Liga\u0026rsquo;s Girona, and the Chinese Super League\u0026rsquo;s Shenzhen New Power (formerly Sichuan Jiuniu). The latter was established by Austria\u0026rsquo;s Red Bull Company and owns clubs such as the Bundesliga\u0026rsquo;s RB Leipzig.\nManchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, UAE Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidential Court, hosted the club\u0026rsquo;s treble-winning manager Pep Guardiola in Abu Dhabi.\nthe rest | original article here Purpose of Using Transfer Data to Analyze Football Corporations: The analysis utilizes transfer data to understand the impact and dynamics of football corporations. This approach provides publicly available data to assess the effects of corporatization in football, including resource sharing, internal cooperation, and competitive strategies among clubs within the same corporate group. Transfer windows reveal how clubs adjust their squads, offering insights into their tactical and operational strategies.\nData Collection and Analysis Process:\nData Source and Scraping:\nData was scraped using Octoparse from the Transfermarkt website, specifically from the Transfer flows pages for each team. Focus was on two major football corporations: City Football Group (CFG) and Red Bull Group. Selection Criteria:\nThe analysis includes Manchester City and Girona from CFG, and RB Leipzig from the Red Bull Group, focusing on these clubs\u0026rsquo; activities from the 2017/18 season to the 2023/24 season. To ensure comparability, only resident clubs that have consistently remained in their respective top leagues since the 2017/18 season were included. Data Points:\nCumulative transfer-in and transfer-out data were collected for each resident club. Data included details such as the number of transfers and loans, the involved amounts, and the leagues of the transfer-in and transfer-out clubs. Key Metrics Analyzed:\nNumber of clubs each resident team has cooperated with in terms of player transfers. Differences in transfer activities, such as permanent transfers versus loans, and the scale of transfers between different leagues. Conclusions: Trends in Top Five Leagues:\nThe Premier League and La Liga are more competitive and attractive, leading to higher talent inflow. Serie A and the Bundesliga have higher proportions of resident teams, indicating less fluctuation in team performance. The Premier League experiences significant performance variance among teams, reflecting intense competition for survival. Corporatization Effects:\nFootball corporations like CFG and Red Bull Group show close cooperation between their clubs, particularly in player transfers and loans. Manchester City tends to loan out players within the group, while RB Leipzig focuses on permanent transfers within the group. The strategic differences between the two corporations are evident in their transfer approaches and investment strategies, with CFG displaying a more cautious investment approach. Implications for Football Corporations:\nEffective corporatization requires a balanced team structure for optimal synergy rather than focusing solely on the strength of individual clubs. The economic benefits and strategic significance of corporatization can be better understood by comparing transfer fees and loan fees within and outside the group. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how football corporatization impacts team dynamics, transfer strategies, and competitive advantages in the top five European leagues.\ndisclaimer: All rights belongs to, and coursey to, the original author.

In a commentary that was published online a minute after the fine was announced, People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, called regulation “a kind of love and care.”\n“Monopoly is the great enemy of the market economy,” the commentary read. “There is no contradiction between regulating under the law and supporting development. Rather, they complement each other and are mutually reinforcing.”\nAntitrust in the changing\nChina started ramping up scrutiny of its tech giants last year. The market regulator proposed updating the antimonopoly law with new provisions for large internet platforms like Alibaba’s. In November, officials halted the plans of Alibaba’s sister company, the finance-focused Ant Group, to go public and tightened their oversight of internet finance.\nIn December, it opened the antimonopoly investigation into Alibaba — a startling turn for Mr. Ma, whom people in China had long held up as an icon of entrepreneurial pluck. In late October, shortly before Ant Group’s shares were expected to begin trading, Mr. Ma had spoken at a conference in Shanghai and accused Chinese financial regulators of stymieing innovation in the name of controlling risk. His remarks were not well received in the state-run news media.\nIs it too late though?\nChina started later than the West on this front. In recent months, apart from the Alibaba investigation, the antitrust authority has also imposed smaller fines on companies for failing to report acquisition deals in advance.\nYet the government’s campaign is already starting to influence the way Chinese internet giants operate, a reflection of the extent to which all private companies in China must stay in Beijing’s good graces to survive.\nFor many years, Alibaba and its archrival, the gaming and social media giant Tencent, have competed ferociously in a variety of businesses, including by deterring their own users from spending time on the other company’s services. That may be starting to change. In a first for the company, Alibaba recently applied for two of its commerce platforms, Taobao Deals and Xianyu, to have a presence on WeChat, Tencent’s ubiquitous messaging app.\nTencent is an obvious potential target for future antimonopoly action by Beijing. With WeChat, the company has created and nurtured an all-in-one platform for news, entertainment, finance, shopping and more, giving it great leverage over rivals and smaller companies as an essential gatekeeper to Chinese internet users.\nThe fine, thin line between too less and too much\n“As companies become large, and as internet services become more and more a part of people’s life, then companies need to be much more responsible, both to the users, to the government, to society,” Tencent’s president, Martin Lau, said last month on a conference call with analysts. “Now I think it’s important for us to understand even more about what the government is concerned about, what the society is concerned about, and be even more compliant.”\nChinese officials do not appear to wish to tip the scales too much against the internet companies, which have legions of loyal users and employ many young, highly educated people.\nNew law on the going\nIn November, not long after officials put Ant Group’s I.P.O. plans on ice, China’s market regulator published draft guidelines for antitrust enforcement of internet platforms. The final rules, which appeared in February, differed in a few key ways.\nOne provision in the draft lowered the bar for the authorities to argue, in certain cases, that a company was a monopolist. That provision did not make it into the final rules. Another clause in the draft that later disappeared would have made it easier for regulators to argue that companies that held large amounts of user data were abusing their dominance.\nThe authorities also do not seem to want to tighten control over internet giants in a way that would undermine China in its strategic rivalry with other global powers — one in particular.\n","permalink":"/posts/the_decade_of_antitrust/","summary":"An old, yet interesting news from the archive\nChina Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion in Landmark Antitrust Case The penalty is the biggest move to date in China’s campaign to tighten supervision of its internet Goliaths.\nBy Raymond Zhong, NY Times, April 9th, 2021.\nBy hitting the e-commerce titan Alibaba with a record $2.8 billion antitrust fine on Saturday, Chinese officials sent a message to the country’s high-flying internet industry: We’ve got our eyes on you.","title":"antitrusting a country's biggest E-commerce platform"},{"content":"A sign of growth: one starts to understand people or fictional characters that used to despise.

PhD work is your sole focus, unlike a corporate job where you’re passively working long hours. Effective time management should start during your PhD.\nPhD students often work excessively due to guilt, pretending to work or working visibly for others. This needs to change. Work genuinely and efficiently for six hours a day, fully engaged. Eliminate warm-up time and get straight into productive work. Reward yourself after a productive day with leisure activities.\nPhD students should also have two hours of social time weekly with “normal” people outside the academic circle. Interact with friends from different backgrounds to gain new perspectives and energy.\nAfter becoming a professor, task-switching becomes crucial. You must manage teaching, reviewing, and administrative duties efficiently. Develop the ability to switch between tasks seamlessly.\nIn my experience, balancing work and family is about maintaining focus. Distractions from family tasks shouldn’t interfere with work. Manage your time well, and you’ll find time for everything without sacrificing quality in any area.\nManage Simple Tasks During Downtime and Save Prime Time for Deep Thinking\nQ: You often mention “throwing punches” when critiquing papers. Is this related to your interest in sports? How do you balance work with outdoor activities and sports?\nWei Jiang: Time management is crucial. My dedicated work hours are short but highly focused. When multitasking, like driving my kids to soccer practice, I use that time to run. Combining activities efficiently helps me manage time better.\nWhile doing household chores, I listen to audio versions of the Wall Street Journal, combining productivity with chores. Assign simpler tasks to downtime and reserve prime thinking time for complex issues.\nAvoid last-minute work. Always plan with a buffer to handle unexpected events.

It can model uniform, U-shaped, or even skewed distributions.\npdf for different $\\alpha, \\beta$ values.\nConvenient Bayesian Update:\nOne of the most important properties of the Beta distribution is its conjugacy with the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions. This means that if the prior distribution of a parameter $ \\theta $ is Beta, then the posterior distribution, after observing data, will also be a Beta distribution.\nbayesian update with beta distribution In a Bayesian framework, we often start with a prior belief about a parameter and update this belief after observing data. The Beta distribution\u0026rsquo;s conjugate property simplifies this update process. Given an unknown parameter $ \\theta_i $ with a prior distribution $ \\theta_i \\sim B(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i) $, we can update our belief after observing the outcome of an experiment $ x^t $.\nPosterior Distribution After Success ($ x^t = 1 $): $$ \\theta_i \\mid x^t = 1 \\sim B(\\alpha_i + 1, \\beta_i) $$ Posterior Distribution After Failure ($ x^t = 0 $): $$ \\theta_i \\mid x^t = 0 \\sim B(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i + 1) $$ This property is particularly useful when working with binary outcomes (success/failure). The Beta distribution allows us to conveniently update our beliefs about the probability of success as we observe more data. at last, a generalization: the Dirichlet distribution The Dirichlet distribution is a generalization of the Beta distribution to multiple variables. It is particularly useful in Bayesian statistics for modeling the probabilities of a multinomial distribution, sharing the conjugate prior property with the Multinomial distribution.\nThe Dirichlet distribution with parameters $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\alpha_K$ is defined as:\n$$ f(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_K) = \\frac{1}{B(\\alpha)} \\prod_{i=1}^K \\theta_i^{\\alpha_i - 1} $$\nwhere $ \\theta_i \\geq 0 $ for all $i$ and $ \\sum_{i=1}^K \\theta_i = 1 $, and $ B(\\alpha) $ is the multivariate Beta function:\n$$ B(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^K \\Gamma(\\alpha_i)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^K \\alpha_i\\right)} $$\n","permalink":"/posts/beta_distribution/","summary":"The Beta distribution is a versatile and useful probability distribution with a wide range of applications in statistics, particularly when associated with modelling unknown probabilities and doing Bayesian inference.

Notice that, for $s_i^t = 0$ (when the volunteer is inactive), the optimal policy is to not pulling the arm and just receives subsidy $\\lambda$. And type of task $k$ doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as well, so we drop superscript $k$ anyway.\nThe above system of equations solve $$ V_i(0) = \\mathbb E_\\kappa[ V_i^\\kappa(1)] + \\frac{\\lambda - \\gamma_i(\\lambda)}{q_i} $$ and, $$ \\gamma_i(\\lambda) + V_i^k(1) =\\mathbb E_\\kappa[ V_i^\\kappa(1)] + \\max\\left(\\frac{p_{k, i}(\\lambda - \\gamma_i(\\lambda))}{q_i} + p_{k, i}w_k, \\lambda\\right). $$ Taking expectation again for $k$: $$ \\gamma_i(\\lambda) = \\mathbb E_k \\max\\left(\\frac{p_{k, i}(\\lambda - \\gamma_i(\\lambda))}{q_i} + p_{k, i}w_k, \\lambda\\right). $$ The above one-dimensional fixed point can be pretty much solved efficiently, as does the rest of $V_i^k(1), \\forall k\\in [K]$.

In such scenarios, traditional decision-making models often fall short. This is where Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMAB) come into play. The method provides a robust framework for modeling and optimizing decisions over time. Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief introduction of the concept of RMAB and the Whittle Index Policy.\nunderstanding Restless Multi-Armed Bandits what are RMAB? The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic version of the problem of optimal allocation of activity under certainty: simply saying, one has $n$ projects, the state of project $i\\in [n]$ being denoted by $x_i(t)$​.\nOne can operate only one project at once: if one operates project $i$ then one receives reward $g_i(x_i(t))$ in the time-interval $(t, t + 1)$ and the transition $x_i(t)\\rightarrow x_i(t + 1)$ follows a Markov rule specific to project $i$. The unused projects neither yield reward nor change state; current states of all projects are known at any time.\nThe problem is to so choose the project at each moment that the expected discounted reward over an infinite future is maximal.\nRestless Multi-Armed Bandits extend this classic multi-armed bandit problem to scenarios where all projects (or, \u0026lsquo;arms\u0026rsquo;) evolve over time, regardless of whether they are chosen, and might incur reward regardless of if being activated. Moreover, one might be able to pull $B$ arms at any time. This dynamic nature makes RMAB particularly applicable to real-world decision-making processes, where neglecting any option can still lead to changes in its state.\nexample Consider a platform coordinating volunteers for various tasks, where each volunteer can either be active or inactive at a certain time point.\nMeanwhile, at each time point, a task arrives randomly, and the platform must decide whom to notify (activate) based on the likelihood of acceptance and the potential reward. This setup forms a basic RMAB model, with each volunteer representing an \u0026lsquo;arm\u0026rsquo; of the bandit:\nthe state transitions of volunteers based on actions and associated probabilities. Active volunteers ($s_t = 1$), when no action is taken ($y_t = 0$) remains active. If action is taken ($y_t = 1$), they might generate a reward w.p. $p_i$ and become inactive, or stay active without generating a reward. Inactive volunteer return to activity based on specific probabilities ($q_i$).\nThe following figure illustrates a typical transition from $t$ to $t + 1$. Decision maker (platform) chooses a subset of volunteers to notify, and the volunteers generate rewards/transition according to their intrinsic probabilities $p_{i, k}, q_i$ and the current type $k$ of the job:\nfrom $t$ to $t + 1$, the platform\u0026rsquo;s action and associated transitions\nGreen Volunteers ($s_t = 1$): Represent active volunteers. When no action is taken ($y_t = 0$), the volunteer remains active in the next period ($s_{t+1} = 1$). When action is taken ($y_t = 1$), with probability $p_i$ a reward is generated and the volunteer transitions to an inactive state ($s_{t+1} = 0$). Otherwise, with probability $1 - p_i$, no reward is generated and the volunteer stays active. Red Volunteers ($s_t = 0$): Represent inactive volunteers. Regardless of action ($y_t = 0$), with probability $q_i$ the volunteer returns to active state in the next period ($s_{t+1} = 1$), and with probability $1 - q_i$​ remains inactive. Inactive volunteers generate no rewards. the Whittle Index Policy –– explained core concept The Whittle Index Policy assigns an index to each arm based on its current state, where the index almost represents the fair price for an arm $i$ when it\u0026rsquo;s being at state $x_i$. Denote the index as $w(x_i)$. The index represents a virtual price for the arm, at which we are indifferent between pulling it or not pulling it. The decision-maker then acts on the arms with the highest indices within the constraints of available resources.\nA crucial aspect of applying the Whittle Index is the property of indexability, which determines whether an arm\u0026rsquo;s index can be computed consistently as system dynamics evolve. Indexability is a property defined for an arm, and serves as the core engine for the Whittle Index Policy (or, more precisely, i\u0026rsquo;d rather call it as a heuristic).\ntheoretical foundations The seminal paper by Whittle (1988) introduced the index and demonstrated its application under conditions of resource constraints.\nWeber and Weiss (1990) extended this theory, showing that under certain conditions, using the Whittle Index is asymptotically optimal, meaning it performs nearly as well as the best possible policy as the number of arms and resources grows.\nThe RMAB framework and Whittle Index Policy find applications in various areas, including healthcare, like managing treatment schedules, and in telecommunications, where they allocate bandwidth among competing channels. Each application benefits from the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to handle dynamic environments efficiently.\nchallenges Despite its advantages, there is still challenges implementing the Whittle Index Policy in real-world scenarios. The biggest of these is the computational complexity involved in calculating the index for a large number of arms, particularly when the state transitions are complex.\nreferences Whittle, P.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief introduction of the concept of RMAB and the Whittle Index Policy.\nunderstanding Restless Multi-Armed Bandits what are RMAB?","title":"RMAB and Whittle index | a modern approach to decision-making"},{"content":"A memoir of Market Mechanism Design course\u0026rsquo;s final presentation report, based on:\nAlgorithmic Classification and Strategic Effort Jon Kleinberg and Manish Raghavan | ACM SIGecom Exchanges, Vol. 18, No. 2, November 2020, Pages 53–60\nmotivation: difference in modelling strategic behavior and objectives–between econ/CS perspectives The principal-agent and strategic machine learning literatures appear to share a common goal: how should one structure a decision-making rule to account for the strategic actions of decision subjects?\nThe paper proposes a model that applies ideas from principal-agent theory to the algorithmic decision-making setting.\nA key feature of models of strategic behavior in both the principal-agent and strategic classification literatures is that of hidden actions: decision-makers can’t observe the exact actions taken by a decision-subject.\nIn the principal-agent literature, this is typically captured through stochastic outcomes, where each action by the agent produces a distribution over possible outcomes, but only one outcome is realized and observed by the principal.\nIn the strategic classification literature, actions are typically not explicitly modeled; instead, a decision-maker simply observes a fea- ture vector, where the values of the feature vector can be strategically manipulated (to a limited degree) by the decision subject.\nmodel The principle has preferences over the underlying behaviors taken by decision subjects. The model requires decisions (of principle) to be made based on observable feature vectors–that he structure his mechanism to incentivize agents take certain behaviors over others.\nAlgorithmic aspect comes in when the paper models the relationship between actions and observations as an effort graph, shown in below.\neffort variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_m$, which are the $m$ actions the agent can take. features $F_1, \\ldots, F_n$ is the $n$-dimensional feature vector the decision maker actually observes.\nIn particular, each edge between $x_j$ and $F_i$ contains a parameter $\\alpha_{ji}$ indicating the degree to which action $j$ increases feature $i$. Formally $$ F_i = f_i \\left (\\sum_{j = 1}^m \\alpha_{ij} x_j \\right) $$ where $f$ is some continuous concave function, and assumed that $\\alpha \\ge 0$. Basically, the larger $\\alpha_{ij}$, the more extent of $x_j$ in increasing $F_i$.\nAssume that the model\u0026rsquo;s structure and parameters are public knowledge.\nThe mechanism designer (i.e. us, or the principle) designs a score function $H = M(\\mathbf F)$, and the agent reacts accordingly $$ \\begin{align}\\text{agent\u0026rsquo;s obj: }\\max_x \\ \u0026amp; M(\\mathbf F)\\cr s.t.\\ \u0026amp; \\sum_{j = 1}^m x_j \\le B \u0026amp; (\\forall i)\\cr \u0026amp; x_j \\ge 0 \u0026amp; (\\forall j) \\end{align} $$ As the designer, we are insterested in whether a particular action (i.e. effort invested) $x^* \\in \\mathbb{R}{}_{\\ge 0}^m$ (or, its support $S(x^*)$) is incentivizable via some scoring rule design of $M(\\cdot)$. The result is:\nlinear mechanisms are optimal in the following sense: whenever a \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo; mechanism can incentivize a particular behavior, there is a linear mechanism that can do so as well.\nMoreover, let\u0026rsquo;s say, we\u0026rsquo;d like to optimize for a set of desirable actions $D\\subset [m]$.

After further testing, the regulator may either grant final approval or reject the drug. We show that conditional approval not only speeds access to drugs but also encourages the development of drugs that would not have been pursued otherwise. Using mechanism design principles, we show that regulators should conditionally approve a drug even if it is ex-ante less likely to prove efficacious, under certain conditions. The regulator should approve the drug to encourage investment, especially when only the firm knows the testing cost. However, drugs that are less likely to prove efficacious should only be conditionally approved for a portion of the patient population if that is enough to motivate testing. Additionally, the impact of conditional approval is greater when the firm\u0026rsquo;s revenue increases over time. Finally, a regulator should sometimes commit that in the future it will grant final approval for a drug that narrowly misses the efficacy threshold in return for the firm testing an otherwise unprofitable drug.\n","permalink":"/posts/mostly_om_3/","summary":"speaker: Peng Sun | Prof., Duke University\nTALK ABSTRACT: New prescription drugs require regulatory approval before drug makers can sell them.

We show how to compute the expected revenue of the clairvoyant firm for a class of rational discrete choice models, and develop prophet-type inequalities that provide performance guarantees for the expected revenue of the traditional assortment optimization firm (a TAOP firm) relative to the clairvoyant firm, and therefore to any effort to personalize assortments. In particular, we show that the expected revenue of the clairvoyant firm cannot exceed twice the expected revenue of the TAOP for the RCS model, the MNL, the GAM and the Nested-Logit Model. On the other hand, there are random utility models for which personalized assortments can earn up to $n$ times more than a TAOP firm, where $n$ is the number of products. Our numerical studies indicate that when the mean utilities of the products are heterogeneous among consumer types, and the variance of the utilities is small, firms can gain substantial benefits from personalized assortments. We support these observations, and others, with theoretical findings. While the consumers’ surplus can potentially be larger under personalized assortments, clairvoyant firms with pricing power can extract all surplus, and earn arbitrarily more than traditional firms that optimize over prices but do not personalize them. For the price-aware MNL, however, a clairvoyant firm can earn at most $\\exp(1)$ more than a traditional firm.\nrelated paper: Bounds, Heuristics, and Prophet Inequalities for Assortment Optimization\nABSTRACT: We introduce odds-ratios in discrete choice models and utilize them to formulate bounds instrumental to the development of heuristics for the assortment optimization problem subject to totally unimodular constraints, and to the assess the benefit of personalized assortments. These heuristics, which only require the first and last-choice probabilities of the underlying discrete choice model, are broadly applicable, efficient, and come with worst-case performance guarantees. We propose a clairvoyant firm model to assess, in the limit, the potential benefits of personalized assortments. Our numerical study indicates that when the mean utilities of the products are heterogeneous among the consumer types, and the variance of the utilities is small, then firms can gain substantial benefits from personalized assortments. We support these observations, and others, with theoretical findings. For regular DCMs, we show that a clairvoyant firm can generate up to n times more in expected revenues than a traditional firm. For discrete choice models with independent value gaps, we demonstrate that the clairvoyant firm can earn at most twice as much as a traditional firm. Prophet inequalities are also shown to hold for a variety of DCMs with dependent value gaps, including the MNL and GAM. While the consumers\u0026rsquo; surplus can potentially be larger under personalized assortments, clairvoyant firms with pricing power can extract all surplus, and earn arbitrarily more than traditional firms that optimize over prices but do not personalize them.

Over the span of a year, this aggressive pricing strategy have caused COTTI\u0026rsquo;s slowing down in its pace of expansion, while luckin Coffee also saw its profits plummet, transitioning from profitability to significant losses.\nBy Xu Qing | Edited by Jin Za\nCOTTI: as if it\u0026rsquo;s playing against the whole world COTTI is determined to win against Luckin Coffee. The relationship between the two companies runs deep—COTTI\u0026rsquo;s founder, Lu Zhengyao, was once the founder of Luckin Coffee. In 2020, Lu was forced out of the company amid allegations of falsifying operational data, leaving with a sense of resentment. The battle with Luckin began from the very first day COTTI was established. In addition to poaching talent from Luckin, COTTI aggressively priced its products at 9.9 yuan to attract Luckin\u0026rsquo;s customers, rapidly expanded its store presence, and strategically positioned many of its outlets right next to Luckin\u0026rsquo;s locations. COTTI employee Song Jia mentioned that the company internally assesses prime locations based on the following criteria: \u0026ldquo;High foot traffic doesn\u0026rsquo;t count, low rent doesn\u0026rsquo;t count, but proximity to a Luckin outlet does.\u0026rdquo;\nNo one at COTTI can escape the shadow of Luckin Coffee. The name Luckin is frequently mentioned in COTTI\u0026rsquo;s offices. Luckin\u0026rsquo;s financial reports are essential reading for the executives, who gather every three months in the meeting room to discuss Luckin\u0026rsquo;s scale and profits. A junior R\u0026amp;D staff member at COTTI remarked, \u0026ldquo;Just a few days into the job, I had already tried almost all of Luckin’s products.\u0026rdquo;\nThe meeting titled \u0026ldquo;How to Continue the Business Battle\u0026rdquo; took place in May, just as the peak season for beverages was about to begin, and also at a crucial point when COTTI launched its aggressive pricing strategy at 9.9 yuan to challenge Luckin. A senior executive in charge of COTTI’s supply chain revealed that one month into the conflict, the average daily sales volume per store nationwide reached about 310-320 cups, with over a thousand new stores opening each month—arguably the fastest expansion rate in the entire coffee industry.\nHowever, six months later, the situation took a drastic turn.\nan unsustainable business model As the summer of 2023 came to an end, COTTI\u0026rsquo;s average daily sales per store began to decline significantly, dropping from about 270 cups in October to 150-160 cups by February. Although winter typically marks the off-season for the coffee and tea beverage industry, a decrease by half is far from normal.\nDue to the low sales volume, a significant number of COTTI\u0026rsquo;s franchisees opted to close their stores––over 800 stores closed in just a few months, with even more franchisees looking to transfer ownership. Facing reduced sales, COTTI initiated substantial layoffs and halted its expansion plans. The company also implemented severe cost-cutting measures, such as downsizing the annual meeting and reducing reimbursements. During a high-level strategic meeting in early 2024, COTTI\u0026rsquo;s founder Lu Zhengyao emphasized the need for heightened \u0026ldquo;risk awareness,\u0026rdquo; indicating a shift in focus due to pressing business challenges.\nthe game has no winner Despite COTTI facing operational challenges, one might expect Luckin to capitalize on these issues. Instead, Luckin also found itself in crisis, recording a net loss of 71.42 million yuan and an operating profit margin of -1% in the first quarter of 2024. This downturn occurred after Luckin had only just achieved profitability in the first quarter of 2022, recovering from a severe financial fraud scandal.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy for Luckin, at all:\nLuckin employed three main strategies: (i) significantly reducing full-time staff in favor of part-time workers, (ii) substituting expensive raw materials with cheaper alternatives, and (iii) closing unprofitable or poorly performing stores to slow down expansion. Despite these efforts, achieving profitability was as challenging as revitalizing a failed construction project. However, the introduction of popular new products like Coconut Latte accelerated Luckin\u0026rsquo;s progress toward profitability.\nBut, when COTTI joins the game, this recent return to losses for Luckin is likened to a student who improves from failing to barely passing, only to fall back again. This oscillation between profit and loss underlines the central insight that in a market where competitors focus more on outmaneuvering each other than on sustainable growth strategies, there are no real winners. Both COTTI and Luckin, locked in a destructive battle, exemplify how such cutthroat competition can lead to a no-win situation, damaging all parties involved and stunting potential growth.\n","permalink":"/posts/between_cotti_and_luckin/","summary":"Prologue\nIn the highly competitive coffee market, a fierce price war erupted with the introduction of the ¥9.9 (~1.37USD) coffee, leading to dramatic changes for two major players: COTTI Coffee and luckin Coffee.

It included classic Italian art songs by Paolo Tosti such as \u0026ldquo;The Last Song,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I Love You No More,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Melancholy,\u0026rdquo; totaling five pieces. The repertoire also featured twelve Chinese art songs, including \u0026ldquo;Three Wishes of the Rose,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Spring Thoughts,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The River Flows Eastward,\u0026rdquo; as well as Gustav Mahler\u0026rsquo;s song cycle \u0026ldquo;Songs of a Wayfarer.\u0026rdquo;\nTosti and Mahler As an Italian composer, Paolo Tosti\u0026rsquo;s compositions often embody the style of Italian folk music. The opening piece, \u0026ldquo;The Guitar of Abruzzi,\u0026rdquo; was written for his friend Caruso in the Abruzzi dialect, followed by four songs depicting various love destinies: romantic memories, eternal vows, and the sadness of unrequited love.\n\u0026ldquo;Songs of a Wayfarer\u0026rdquo; is Austrian composer Gustav Mahler\u0026rsquo;s first art song cycle, premiered in 1896. The cycle comprises four songs, including \u0026ldquo;When My Sweetheart is Married,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I Walked Past Fields at Dawn,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I Have a Gleaming Dagger Hidden in My Breast,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;My Sweetheart\u0026rsquo;s Blue Eyes.\u0026rdquo; These songs narrate the journey of a young man abandoned by his lover, wandering aimlessly seeking solace. More accurately, the cycle reflects Mahler\u0026rsquo;s autobiographical account of his troubled romance with the singer Johanna Richter during his tenure at the Kassel Theater.\n\u0026ldquo;Songs of a Wayfarer\u0026rdquo; was a piece Liao \u0026ldquo;liked very much but didn’t quite have the courage to sing.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It represents a failed love affair from his youth, and I try to feel his helplessness and loneliness. The first song describes him watching a lively wedding alone, enduring the heartbreak of lost love, and weeping quietly,\u0026rdquo; Liao explained.\nChinese Lieder selections In addition to German-Austrian and Italian music, the performance also included a vast array of traditional Chinese songs like \u0026ldquo;Searching for Plum Blossoms in the Snow\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Prelude to Water Melody: When Will the Moon Be Clear?\u0026rdquo; These songs, mostly derived from ancient poetry, portray various interpretations and emotions about nature and life, eliciting a profound emotional response from the audience.\nAmong the performed pieces, \u0026ldquo;Three Wishes of the Rose\u0026rdquo; left a significant impression on Liao. \u0026ldquo;I wish that the merciless storms that envy me do not batter me, I wish that the passionate tourists who love me do not pluck me, I wish that my beauty remains unfading, so I may preserve my bloom.\u0026rdquo; Ostensibly a woman\u0026rsquo;s prayer for eternal beauty, it is actually a plea through the voice of a rose, begging that the ruthless wars and hardships do not ravage my homeland.\nrooted in classical poetry In the 1920s, the composer Qing Zhu initiated the Chinese art song with \u0026ldquo;Aria of Nostalgia: The River Flows Eastward,\u0026rdquo; which became a staple in the vocal training of higher music education institutions in New China, leading and advancing the development of Chinese vocal arts. Over the years, Liao has also focused on exploring, organizing, and promoting Chinese art songs, performing them in Switzerland, Vienna, Germany, Finland, and other places, echoing the voice of China.\nDuring performances at home and abroad, Liao enjoys singing the classic Sichuan folk song \u0026ldquo;When Will the Locust Flowers Bloom?\u0026rdquo; These dialect-infused songs, rich with Chinese characteristics, are favored by many foreign audiences. Once, during a tour in Norway, Liao found himself chased by enthusiastic fans, later discovering they particularly enjoyed his renditions of Chinese songs.\nBeautiful! And the stories goes on\u0026hellip;\nmaking art lasting and more accessible In June 2019, Liao performed in Germany. After attending Liao\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Chinese Classical Poetry Art Song Concert,\u0026rdquo; Nick Pfefferkorn, the head of the German music publishing house Edition Peters, was deeply moved. Subsequently, both parties agreed to initiate the international publishing project \u0026ldquo;Three Wishes of the Rose: 16 Chinese Art Songs.\u0026rdquo;\nLiao also specifically adapted the international phonetic notation for \u0026ldquo;Three Wishes of the Rose\u0026rdquo; according to the international pronunciation and reading demonstration standards set by Edition Peters, hoping that the notation would help singers worldwide to accurately render Chinese songs.\nHis long-time partner, Hartmut Höll, also remarked on the development of Chinese art songs over the years. Since 2018, he has collaborated with Liao, noting that through the international promotion of Chinese art songs, European audiences have deeply resonated with the stories told in the Chinese language, underscoring the true purpose of music.\nAfter the Shanghai performance, on June 10, both musicians will travel to the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany, to conclude this \u0026ldquo;Tale of Two Cities\u0026rdquo; concert series.\nSince 1986, Shanghai has been twinned with Hamburg. Liao said, \u0026ldquo;To better reflect exchange and mutual learning, I have selected a set of pieces that includes German-Austrian art songs, Chinese art songs, and Italian songs for performances in both Shanghai and Hamburg, hoping to bridge cultures and let the world experience the charm of Chinese art songs.\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"/posts/lied_report/","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a professional, in-depth intepretation of the Liederabend performance of Changyong Liao, originally in Chinese, available here.\nThe program selected works from Italy, Germany-Austria, and China, each with distinct artistic themes.

But for classical music enthusiasts, the word signifies songs with piano accompaniment circa 1800–1900 – the birth of the form which coincided with the rise of the poetry-enjoying European middle classes in the wake of the French Revolution.\nExplainer: What Are Lieder? by Graham Johnson OBE.\nLieder represents perhaps the most expressive sub-genre within classical music. These compositions, typically performed in relaxed afternoon salons, are based on poetry and sung with a freedom that contrasts with the rigid structures of concertos.\nWhile most songs start with a melody, Lieder begin with poetry.\nHow they’re written All songs have lyrics, but in many cases the tune comes first. With Lieder the opposite is true: the poet is often more than the composer’s equal and the poem is often a great work of art in its own right, known and loved without music.\nThe composer’s task is to give this poem a heightened existence through their own vision and imaginative skill. The song’s melody and text are the singer’s responsibility, but it is the addition of a piano accompaniment, subtle and sometimes highly complex, that adds harmony and character to the whole. The greatest Lieder composers conjure an astonishing variety of narratives, moods and atmospheres, a synthesis of word and tone employing almost minimalist means that can take the listener’s breath away.\nPerformers have to be very word-aware when presenting a poem through this musical prism – a great Lied may be first and foremost an unforgettable piece of music, but the poem that breathes within the structure is its life-force.\nThe poet\u0026rsquo;s voice is paramount, often overshadowing the composer\u0026rsquo;s. The composer\u0026rsquo;s role is to elevate the poem with their unique vision, crafting a melody that, together with the singer and subtle piano accompaniments, creates a harmonious and character-rich performance. This minimalist synthesis of word and tone can be breathtaking, transforming a simple poem into an unforgettable musical experience.\nLieder combines the potent arts of poetry and music, a union too profound to yield anything mundane. Geniuses like Schubert have taken revered poems and amplified their power through the magic of their compositions.\nThe leaders in Lieder Very few of the thousands of composers who wrote Lieder reached the pinnacle of this form. After Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Hugo Wolf (almost exclusively a Lieder composer) are considered the Immortals, closely followed by Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss.\nThe greatest Lieder composer is undoubtedly Schubert. Ealiest champions of Lieders include Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. But it was Schubert who wrote over 600 songs in his lifetime, to have defined and shaped this particular form of song and later, popularized it into other languages.\nSchubert Schubert, in particular, is renowned for the textural richness of his music—it\u0026rsquo;s all about texture, timbre, and the buoyant lightness that characterizes these quaint, charming pieces. One of my favorites is Die Forelle (The Trout), a jovial melody about fishing. This piece was brilliantly recorded by Fritz Wunderlich \u0026amp; Hubert Giesen, available here: Die Forelle, Op. 32, D. 550. My love for it was sparked not in a concert hall, but through its clever use in the film Sherlock Holmes (2020), directed by Guy Ritchie, where it underscored a memorably dark yet playful scene:\nIn a haunting scene from Sherlock Holmes (2020), directed by Guy Ritchie, the nefarious Professor Moriarty captures Holmes and suspends him from a hook, inflicting pain on his greatest adversary. As Moriarty revels in the torture, he sang along Schubert\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Die Forelle,\u0026rsquo; highlighting the juxtaposition of beauty and brutality, and a play with word. Witness this powerful moment where classical music meets cinematic artistry. Watch the clip here.\nThis is the continuing impact of art –– bridging history and modernity, poetry and music.\n@Adamguy2003 While Pf. Moriarty is usually quite good at putting up a seemingly sophisticated front, this is the one scene when he lets it all down and shows what a twisted, demented psychopath he truly is. A magnificent portrayal of one of the greatest villains in all of literature.\nAnd it couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been done without Schubert, for sure.\n","permalink":"/posts/lied/","summary":"Lieder in a nutshell The plural German noun Lieder (singular Lied) simply means “songs” – any kind of songs.

This semester I\u0026rsquo;m TAing for Advanced Optimization –– an obligatory course for sophomore students. I\u0026rsquo;ve also took last year. Moreover, I took an even more advanced version of it (convex optimization) while I was visiting Stanford last summer. Still, teaching and tutoring turns out not to be something that comes out of thin air. I thought I can just do the assignments and gradings within minutes, give the recitation session without any efforts or too much investment in preparing––turns out the truth is quite the opposite.\nA Handbook for Mathematics Teaching Assistants established an excellent framework to structuralize our reasoning about what is important in being a good TA.\nTypes of TA Assignments: Recitation, Lecture, Grading Most teaching assignments for graduate students fall into one of three categories:\nrecitation instructor:\na faculty member lectures to a large class of students two or three times a week on an assigned topic from a textbook, after which a graduate student answers questions about the lecture and discusses assigned homework problems.\nlecture:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s more demanding, almost like an upgrade of the previous task. Schools vary as to when in a graduate student\u0026rsquo;s career this is to be done; at some institutions you are handed an algebra and trigonometry text and told, \u0026ldquo;Go teach this. Don\u0026rsquo;t mess up!\u0026rdquo; Other schools wait for a year or two until you have had some less demanding assignments before they ask you to plan lessons, make up your own exams, determine grading policy, and generally deal with the problems of teaching undermotivated freshmen (or worse, undermotivated seniors!) the joys of precalculus.\ngrading:\nMany TAs describe such assignments as \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;boring.\u0026rdquo; While the assignments can be either or both, grading jobs, however, can teach you how far you have come since the days when this coursematerial was a real effort. These assignments can also show you how hard it is to teach others to write clear, concise answers and proofs.\nA third benefit to a grading job is that you can use it to review the material that may be asked on a graduate comprehensive examination.\nrecitation Explain those chapter exercises from the textbook seems not much of a big deal––since most of the problems even have solution manuals. However\nA shocking number of TAs and instructors try to \u0026ldquo;wing it\u0026rdquo; often with unpleasant consequences for themselves, their students, and for their end of term evaluations. So I will say this again, with emphasis:\nA recitation instructor will show up on time prepared to discuss past and current homework problems.\nThis means that you will read through all the problems the night before recitation, you will perform the required computations (Yes, the chain rule is dull, and you have used it so often before, but, just when you don\u0026rsquo;t prepare a set of problems because they\u0026rsquo;re too easy, that\u0026rsquo;s when you\u0026rsquo;ll get stuck in front of your class on the day before the exam.), and you will get \u0026ldquo;the answer in the back of the book,\u0026rdquo; because that\u0026rsquo;s the one the students prize so highly.\nWhy do you want to prepare meticulously when you know this stuff so well? Because:\nPeople never learn course material as well as when they have to explain it to others. Even though you took and passed this course some years ago, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can\u0026rsquo;t learn from a refresher. After all, it was six years ago in high school that you took AP calculus, right? Textbook authors love to put little tricks into the exercises to keep students on their toes; these tricks can trip up unsuspecting instructors, too. You are getting paid to do these exercises. Even a TA who has done this course three times already needs to recall where the pitfalls are placed.\ngrading issues Ever since being a TA do I finally realized scoring rule design––recall Jason Hartline\u0026rsquo;s research papers that used TA as a motivating example. TA needs to exert effort (cost) so as to grade with high accuracy (utility maximizers), but professors and students somehow always wants accuracy (value maximizers). Therefore, on one side there\u0026rsquo;s the tricky design problem that aligns the incentive of the principle (professor) and the agent (TA), one the other side, being a TA means that one should be responsible and say no to the lure of grading everyone a 100 out of nowhere.\nA common, but not universal, technique for grading homework is to assign each problem a fixed number of points. Some graders use a two-point system, \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; for a wrong answer, \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; for OK but not complete, \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo; for fully correct. After using this methodology once or twice, most graders find that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough points to properly distinguish among the variety of possible errors that a group of students can make. Students also tend to sense the same problem. Their complaint about the grading is usually to say something like, \u0026ldquo;I only got one number wrong, and all I got was a 1\u0026rdquo;.\nA zero to five scale is probably better:\n\u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash; didn\u0026rsquo;t even try the problem,\n\u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash; tried, but not even close,\n\u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;3\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash; various levels of somewhat valid but mistaken attempts,\n\u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash; correct answer but with some minor errors,\n\u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash; the correct answer with details spelled out.\nUniformity with fairness and speed are keys to grading exams. Doing the job though, is almost like an online learning process:\nAs you grade the first few papers, occasionally review your scheme to see if it still seems to fit what the students actually knew and did. This review will also help avoid grade inflation or deflation that seems so inevitable over ten hours of work (\u0026ldquo;This is the same mistake that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a hundred times now well, this time you get a zero!\u0026rdquo;)\nUniformity and fairness are related to one another. You may be a harder grader than your officemate, but if you can defend your methodology to other TAs and students, they will \u0026ldquo;generally\u0026rdquo; accept it. (Note that last generally. Some may not; see the section on being a good colleague.)\nMost TAs see the \u0026ldquo;speed\u0026rdquo; part of \u0026ldquo;grading with speed\u0026rdquo; as only being of benefit to themselves\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;I want to get this pile of papers done and out of here!\u0026rdquo; But speed with accuracy also benefits students, because they get to have their problems back while they still remember what the questions were.\n","permalink":"/posts/ta_conduct1/","summary":"Working as a teaching assistant for college mathematics or general mathematically inclined courses turns out to be not as trivial a task as I\u0026rsquo;ve thought it to be.

However, the real-world often presents scenarios where such comprehensive information is unavailable. Here, Reinforcement Learning (RL) steps in with model-free methods that leverage DP principles but operate without the need for explicit transition probabilities or rewards.\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) Framework An MDP is a mathematical framework used to describe an environment in decision-making problems where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. MDPs are defined by the following components:\nStates $ S $: A finite set of states that the system can be in.\nActions $ A $: For each state $ s $, there exists a finite set of actions $ A(s) $ available to the decision-maker.\nTransition Probability $ P(s\u0026rsquo;, s \\mid a) $: The probability of moving from state $ s $ to state $ s\u0026rsquo; $ after taking action $ a $.\nReward Function $ R(s, a, s\u0026rsquo;) $: The immediate reward received after transitioning from state $ s $ to state $ s\u0026rsquo; $, due to action $ a $.\nDiscount Factor $ \\gamma $​: A factor between 0 and 1 that discounts future rewards, reflecting the preference for immediate rewards over future ones.\nObjective: The decision-maker\u0026rsquo;s objective is to find a policy $\\pi$ that is essentially a mapping from state to action, and maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time: $$ \\max_\\pi \\mathbb E [\\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\gamma^tR(s, \\pi(s))] $$\nLinking MDPs to Reinforcement Learning In traditional DP, solving an MDP involves calculating the optimal policy to maximizes cumulative rewards, using complete knowledge of $ P $ and $ R $. Reinforcement Learning, particularly the model-free approach, simplifies this by not requiring explicit knowledge of these functions, thus enabling learning and decision-making directly from interactions with the environment.\nModel-free RL methods, such as Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference learning, approximate the key functions of MDPs (value functions and policies) through experiences, adjusting their estimates towards optimal values as more data is gathered from the environment. This adaptability makes RL suited for complex and dynamic environments where traditional DP might be impractical.\nMonte Carlo Methods Monte Carlo methods are essential in the toolkit of model-free reinforcement learning, particularly valued for their simplicity and efficacy in episodic tasks, where each episode is a sequence of states, actions, and rewards that eventually reaches a terminal state.\nPrediction and Control in Monte Carlo Methods Monte Carlo methods are divided into two primary tasks: prediction and control, each serving a unique purpose in learning and policy optimization.\nPrediction: The objective here is to estimate the value function $V_\\pi(s)$ for a given policy $\\pi$. $V_\\pi(s)$ represents the expected return (cumulative discounted rewards) when starting from state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ thereafter. Monte Carlo prediction calculates this by averaging the returns observed after many episodes, specifically focusing on returns starting from state $s$​. The update formula for the value function in Monte Carlo prediction is: $$ V(S_t) \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{N(S_t)} \\sum_{i=1}^{N(S_t)} G_i $$\nwhere $N(S_t)$ is the number of times state $S_t$ has been visited, and $G_i$ are the returns observed in these visits.\nControl: While prediction is about evaluating a policy, control is about improving it. The goal in the control setting is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected return from any given state. This is typically done using the action-value function $Q(s, a)$, which estimates the expected return after taking an action $a$ in state $s$ and thereafter following policy $\\pi$. The challenge in Monte Carlo control is ensuring that all actions are sufficiently explored, which is addressed by techniques like $\\epsilon$-soft policies. The update formula for the action-value function in Monte Carlo control is: $$ Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{N(S_t, A_t)} \\sum_{i=1}^{N(S_t, A_t)} G_i $$ where $N(S_t, A_t)$ is the number of times the action $A_t$ has been taken in state $S_t$, and $G_i$ are the returns following these actions.\nOn-Policy vs. Off-Policy Learning Control methods can be implemented in two forms: on-policy and off-policy, each with its approach to exploring and learning:\nOn-Policy Learning: In this approach, the learning policy $\\pi$ is also the policy used to generate behavior. This means that the value function or action-value function directly reflects the outcomes of decisions made by the policy itself. An example of on-policy learning in Monte Carlo methods is when using an $\\epsilon$-soft policy, where the policy remains slightly random to ensure all states are explored.\nOff-Policy Learning: Contrary to on-policy, off-policy methods use a different policy for generating behavior than the one being evaluated and improved. This is useful for learning from exploratory data or an existing dataset of behavior generated by a different policy. In Monte Carlo methods, this often involves using an $\\epsilon$​-greedy policy for exploration while updating the estimates towards the greedy policy\u0026rsquo;s values. The importance sampling ratio is crucial here to adjust the estimates to reflect the policy\u0026rsquo;s probability distribution.\nsummary for MC Monte Carlo methods provide a straightforward yet powerful approach to solving reinforcement learning problems, particularly in environments with clear episode boundaries. By directly estimating value functions from complete episodes, these methods offer a blend of simplicity and directness in tackling both prediction and control challenges in model-free settings.\nTemporal Difference (TD) Learning Temporal Difference (TD) learning stands out as a pivotal method in reinforcement learning due to its ability to learn directly from raw experience without a model of the environment\u0026rsquo;s dynamics. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, which wait until the end of an episode to update value estimates, TD learning updates estimates incrementally after each step.\nprediction and control in TD learning TD learning can be used for both prediction and control tasks in reinforcement learning:\nPrediction: The goal is to estimate the value function $ V(s) $ for a given policy. TD learning updates the value function after each time step, using the observed reward and the estimated value of the subsequent state. This update, known as bootstrapping, combines observed rewards with existing value estimates: $$ V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\alpha\\left[\\text{TD target} - V(S_t)\\right] $$ where the TD target is typically $ R_{t + 1} + \\gamma V(S_{t + 1}) $, combining the reward received after taking action $ A_t $ and the discounted estimate of the next state\u0026rsquo;s value.\nControl: The objective in the control setting is to find an optimal policy. This involves learning the optimal action-value function $ Q(s, a) $, which estimates the expected return after taking action $ a $ in state $ s $ and thereafter following an optimal policy. TD methods for control include on-policy approaches like SARSA and off-policy methods such as Q-learning.\nSARSA vs. Q-learning TD methods can be implemented as either on-policy or off-policy, each with distinct characteristics:\nOn-Policy (SARSA): SARSA, which stands for State-Action-Reward-State-Action, updates the action-value function based on the action actually taken, as determined by the current policy (typically $\\epsilon$-greedy): $$ Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha\\left[ R_{t + 1} + \\gamma Q(S_{t + 1}, A_{t + 1}) - Q(S_t, A_t)\\right] $$ This approach directly incorporates the decision-making process into the learning algorithm, maintaining a close adherence to the policy\u0026rsquo;s behavior.\nOff-Policy (Q-learning): Q-learning seeks to find the optimal policy directly, regardless of the agent\u0026rsquo;s actions. It updates the action-value function using the maximum value of the next state, regardless of the action taken by the policy: $$ Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha\\left[ R_{t + 1} + \\gamma \\max_{a\u0026rsquo;} Q(S_{t + 1}, a\u0026rsquo;) - Q(S_t, A_t)\\right] $$ Q-learning typically converges faster than SARSA as it always assumes optimal future actions, making it a robust choice for environments where a precise model of the environment is unknown.\nsome variants of TD learning address specific challenges or scenarios: Expected SARSA: Averages over possible next actions rather than relying on a single sample, reducing variance and potentially improving learning stability––computationally costly but converges faster.\nDouble Q-learning: Uses two separate value estimates to decouple the action selection from the target value calculation, addressing the overestimation bias common in standard Q-learning.\nsummary of TD Temporal Difference (TD) learning is crucial for enabling learning from incomplete sequences of experience, without waiting for the end of an episode. Among its variants, Q-learning is particularly noteworthy. It updates its estimates using the best available actions, thereby directly targeting the optimal policy, regardless of the agent\u0026rsquo;s actions during exploration. This method not only accelerates convergence but also reduces dependency on specific policies during data generation, enhancing its application in dynamic and complex environments.\nQ-learning exemplifies the efficiency and effectiveness of TD learning, making it a key strategy in AI and autonomous system development.\n$n$-step SARSA: bridging MC and TD learning The core idea behind n-Step SARSA is to update the value estimates based on $n$ steps of experience rather than relying on a single step (as in standard TD learning) or waiting until the end of an episode (as in MC methods). This approach allows the algorithm to incorporate more comprehensive trajectory information into each update, improving the quality of the policy evaluation and development without the full delay of episode completion required by pure MC methods.\nalgorithm key detail The update function for n-Step SARSA is a natural extension of the single-step SARSA, incorporating rewards and state transitions over $n$ steps: $$ Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha\\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\dots + \\gamma^n Q(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}) - Q(S_t, A_t)\\right] $$ This formula uses the real (environment feedback) reward over first $n$ steps, while afterwards just adding up using the (discounted) estimate $Q$. This n-step perspective helps in smoothing out the learning updates, providing a balance between immediate and delayed rewards, and typically leads to more stable learning convergence.\n","permalink":"/posts/rl_via_dp/","summary":"Dynamic Programming (DP) serves as a foundational approach in computational algorithms, especially effective in environments with complete knowledge of state transitions and rewards, described within the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework.

More specificallly, for any interval $[T_1, T_2]$ we\u0026rsquo;d have $$ \\lim_{|\\Pi|\\to 0}\\sum_{j = 1}^n|W_{t_j} - W_{t_{j-1}}| = +\\infty $$ where $\\Pi :={t_0, t_1, \\ldots t_n} $ is a partition of $[T_1, T_2]$​ and $|\\Pi|$ is its mesh: $$ |\\Pi| :=\\max_{j\\in [n]}|t_j - t_{j-1}| $$\nBounded quadratic variation: similarly, for any interval $[T_1, T_2]$ of a Brownian motion $W_t$: $$ \\lim_{|\\Pi|\\to 0}\\sum_{j = 1}^n|W_{t_j} - W_{t_{j-1}}|^2 = T_2 - T_1 $$ Essentially, we can define quadratic variation process for any continuous random varaible of bounded quadratic variation ${X_t, t\\ge 0}$: $$ \\lang X, X\\rang_t := \\lim_{|\\Pi|\\to 0}\\sum_{j = 1}^n|X_{t_j} - X_{t_{j-1}}|^2. $$ Specifically, for Brownian motion: $\\lang W, W\\rang_t = t$.\nBecause Brownian motion is not of unbounded variable, its sample path $W(t)$ is (almost) not (Riemann) integrable.\nBut mathematicians don\u0026rsquo;t stop from here.

The United States has been facing serious obesity problem for decades, and now East Asia, particularly Shanghai, appears to be catching up. This trend is rooted in macroeconomic factors. The general decline in growth rate has increased stress levels, causing people to lower their consumption standards. In such times, easily accessible, unhealthy, yet delicious food becomes a cheap dopamine booster. The phrase \u0026ldquo;happiness is the same price as Red-Bottoms\u0026rdquo; holds true only if one can afford them. The economic downturn has led capital to venture into the general food industry, especially in Shanghai, where bakeries are flourishing.\nChained, standardized bakeries, cafés, and restaurants are replacing the ecosystem of traditional, often independently operated businesses. These establishments offer oily, sugary, and unhealthy products like creamy cakes and cookies or large, over-served portions of meals and buffets. Positioned as luxury enjoyments and sold at inflated prices, these options are capturing the attention and money of the younger population.\nThe Solution Being mindful of what we consume is crucial. According to observations, women are often more adept and knowledgeable about dieting. Various methods like the 16-8 fasting method, cheat days, ketogenic diet, Mediterranean diet (high in vegetables, fruits, pulses, and whole grains, low in red and processed meats and saturated fats), and the MIND diet (emphasizing berries over other fruits) are popular. I have personally experimented with all these diets.\nInsights from The Economist \u0026ldquo;A good meal has a positive impact on one’s mood. Part of that pleasure is immediate. Those who avoid overindulgence and family squabbles will enjoy a postprandial rise in their blood sugar. That will prompt a flood of endorphins—chemicals that act as happy hormones—to rush through their brains.\u0026rdquo;\nAnimal proteins, such as those found in roast fowl, hams, or fish, contain essential amino acids necessary for the production of dopamine and serotonin, neurotransmitters that regulate pleasure, reward, and mood. Brussels sprouts contain folate, crucial for brain function, while cranberries are high in vitamin C, which is involved in converting dopamine to noradrenaline, another neurotransmitter.\nWith mental-health disorders on the rise, scientists are increasingly investigating how food or nutritional supplements affect the mind. The brain, being the most complex and energy-demanding organ, has specialized nutritional needs. Emerging research in nutritional psychiatry highlights the significance of diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, flavonoids, antioxidants, and resveratrol. These nutrients, found in foods like walnuts, tea, wine, berries, and red grapes, promote neuron growth and reduce inflammatory processes in the brain, which is associated with a lower risk of developing depression.\nThe link between diet and mental health is becoming clearer. The Mediterranean diet, for instance, is shown to decrease the chances of experiencing strokes, cognitive impairment, and depression. A green Mediterranean diet high in polyphenols reduces age-related brain atrophy, while the MIND diet, emphasizing berry consumption, lessens the risk of dementia.\n\u0026ldquo;Nutritional science is understudied partly because it is hard to do well. Randomized controlled trials, used to test drugs, are tricky. Few people want to stick to an experimental diet for years. Instead, most nutritional science is based on observational studies that try to establish associations between particular foods or nutrients and diseases.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile 10% of adults in America consume their recommended daily serving of vegetables, the majority turn to vitamin and mineral supplements to make up for dietary deficiencies. Despite the prevalence of supplements, rigorous research on their benefits and risks is limited. The potential of micronutrients to treat mental-health conditions remains an intriguing yet underexplored area of study.\nIn conclusion, the food we consume significantly affects both our physical and mental health. Being mindful of our diet, experimenting with scientifically-backed dietary methods, and understanding the nutritional needs of our brain can help improve our overall well-being. As nutritional psychiatry continues to evolve, it offers promising insights into how we can better nourish our minds and bodies through our dietary choices.\n","permalink":"/posts/nutrition_and_moods/","summary":"reading write-up: How Food Affects the Mind and Body December 20, 2022, The Economist\nthe trend The take-out delivery industry is booming, paralleling the general food industry\u0026rsquo;s growth in Shanghai.

The market, a duopoly, had two bidders: Mannesmann and T-Mobile.\nMannesman opened with a bid of 20 million deutsche mark per megahertz for blocks 1–5 and 18.18 million for blocks 6– 10. Why 18.18? A rule of the auction was that any subsequent bid had to be at least 10 percent higher than the prevailing bid. Given that 10 percent higher than 18.18 is 20, was Mannesman signaling to T-Mobile that it should follow up with a bid of 20 million on blocks 6–10, so that each would receive five blocks at this low price? Well, that is exactly what happened. T-Mobile bid 20 million on blocks 6–10, and there were no subsequent bids.\ntheory works well, theoretically The standard Cournot model almost assumes symmetric firms making up the market. However, consider a would-be cartel among gasoline stations in Quebec:\nOne source of differences among these retailers was their per-unit cost of gasoline. Larger retailers, such as Bilodeau-Shell, negotiated lower wholesale prices; Ultramar, vertically integrated with its refinery, had lower costs. Another asymmetry was that some stations sold complementary products, such as Loblaws (a supermarket chain) and Couche-Tard (a chain of convenience stores). Firms with lower costs or complementary products (where gasoline might be a loss leader) preferred a lower collusive price than others. Consistent with significant heterogeneity in preferences, it took a lot of negotiation to settle on a price. Thanks to wiretapping of their phones by the competition authority, we know that agreeing to a price increase took about sixty-five phone calls.\nin the hands of the dealers The Nasdaq system, operates through a network of (human) market maker––dealers.\nAt least two market makers are associated with each Nasdaq stock. Each posts a bid price (to buy) and an ask price (to sell). The difference between the lowest ask price and the highest bid price forms the “inside spread,” the dealers\u0026rsquo; return. For example, if the lowest ask price is $10⅜ and the highest bid price is $10, then the spread (gross revenue for the dealer) is ⅜.\nEach dealer competes by posting lower ask prices and higher bid prices. More intense competition compresses spreads. Notably, prior to June 1997, Nasdaq required price fractions for bid and ask quotes to be multiples of ⅛.\nA Chinese proverb says, \u0026ldquo;where there are people, there are delicate interactions.\u0026rdquo;\nWilliam Christie and Paul Schultz noticed something odd: many Nasdaq stocks were rarely quoted in odd eighths, like $10⅛. The scholars hypothesized that dealers had developed a collusive norm of avoiding odd-eighth quotes to impose a minimum inside spread of ¼.\nEvidence consistent with this hypothesis emerged when the study was publicized in the Los Angeles Times on May 26, 1994. The next day, the number of market makers of Microsoft using even eighths exclusively dropped from forty-one to one.\nAnd so, dear reader, we all know what\u0026rsquo;s going on. May these stories remind you that behind every price and every trade, there\u0026rsquo;s a tale.

Like a train that wait for no one, departing at 8 AM sharp—almost as if the universe itself is in on this conspiracy against procrastination.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an economic oddity: completing these tasks early almost never fetches us a bonus, yet overshooting the deadline incurs the wrath of consequences. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that just the perfect setup to promote structured procrastination?\noptimal scheduling: the greedy algorithm’s Achilles\u0026rsquo; heel In the ideal world of computational theory, the greedy algorithm suggests that we tackle tasks in order of their deadlines. Sounds neat, right? But here\u0026rsquo;s the catch: this method works under the unrealistic assumption that we know exactly how long each task will take. Reality check—life isn\u0026rsquo;t that predictable.\nIn real life, tasks arrive in a constant, unrelenting stream, and the time each one takes is as uncertain as my commitment to start dieting (again). Plus, the opportunity cost of time is significant. Let’s be honest, who wants to spend a Saturday night grinding through a machine learning assignment due, not tonight?\ncase study: the tale of two delivery types Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about food delivery because, honestly, I order from Meituan more often than I\u0026rsquo;d like to admit. The platform always sets a tight deadline for delivery and offered the real-time location tracking thus lets me track my deliverer every now and then. The suspense of waiting blends the mundane with the thrill of a gamble—will my food arrive in time for me to devour it during my short lunch break?\nHere, there are two types of delivery heroes:\nThe Speedsters: These guys pick up the order and zoom off so quickly they often arrive before I even make it out of class. Their over-efficiency, albeit impressive, sometimes leaves me dashing out in a panic, whispering apologies to my professor about a \u0026lsquo;stomach emergency\u0026rsquo;. The Deadline Dancers: These are the ones who flirt dangerously with deadlines, mastering the art of punctuality—to the very last second. They optimize their delivery routes not just to ensure your food arrives \u0026ldquo;on time\u0026rdquo; but that it does so with a precision that would make a Swiss watch jealous. Quiet morning? They’ll wait. Rush hour? They become a living embodiment of a multi-threaded, real-time optimization problem, solving traffic, distance, and timing with the finesse of a seasoned logistician. This is where the economic concept of \u0026rsquo;time inconsistency\u0026rsquo; and the allure of \u0026rsquo;last-minute\u0026rsquo; pressure come into play. Why rush when the deadline is an hour away, and why start early when you can deliver an adrenaline-pumped performance at the last second?\nJust as we often procrastinate until the pressure builds into a monstrous wave pushing us towards productivity, these deliverers manage their schedules in a way that might seem baffling but is all too human. After all, how many of us aren’t guilty of watching just one more episode on Netflix before finally, reluctantly, turning to our responsibilities?\nSo, the next time you find yourself cursing a delivery that arrives just in the nick of time, remember: it\u0026rsquo;s just another day, another deadline, and perhaps, a reflection of our own tendencies to delay, defer, and ultimately, deliver.\n","permalink":"/posts/more_time/","summary":"Happy Sunday!

Stephen J. Dubner. Mar 6, 2024, Freakonomics.\nIn this episode, Stephen Dubner interviewed Ben HANDEL and Leonardo BURSZTYN about their new paper:\nWhen Product Markets Become Collective Traps: The Case of Social Media. Leonardo Bursztyn, Benjamin R. Handel, Rafael Jimenez \u0026amp; Christopher Roth. 2023.\nABSTRACT Individuals might experience negative utility from not consuming a popular product. For example, being inactive on social media can lead to social exclusion or not owning luxury brands can be associated with having a low social status. We show that, in the presence of such spillovers to non-users, standard measures that take aggregate consumption as given fail to appropriately capture welfare. We propose a new methodology to measure welfare that accounts for these consumption spillovers, which we apply to estimate the consumer surplus of two popular social media platforms, TikTok and Instagram. In large-scale, incentivized experiments with college students, we show that, while the standard welfare measure suggests a large and positive surplus, our measure accounting for consumption spillovers indicates a negative surplus, with a large share of active users deriving negative utility. We also shed light on the drivers of consumption spillovers to non-users in the case of social media and show that, in this setting, the “fear of missing out” plays an important role. Our framework and estimates highlight the possibility of product market traps, where large shares of consumers are trapped in an inefficient equilibrium and would prefer the product not to exist.\nsome highlight of the podcast: Simply speaking, a product market trap arises when:\n[BURSZTYN] Maybe there are products that people buy but they wish these products didn’t exist.\nThe notion of welfare is being augmented–to take into account when people\u0026rsquo;s willingness to pay for a product depends on others\u0026rsquo; interaction as well. This is almost of a higher-level, more intricate presentation of the network effect.\n[BURSZTYN] Our work, and a lot of other people’s work, point to the benefits for the platform of having scale, having big networks. And you can see how a platform might even provide subsidies to really grow their network — because when you get so big, it becomes very hard for consumers not to join your platform, so there’s really a rationale for growing, growing, growing. That’s one thing. Now, there’s another set of questions that also relate to social media, which is how platforms can design their algorithms to reinforce these effects. People have focused a lot on how can they make things addictive, like dopamine kicks and so on, or pushing toxic content that increases engagement and outrage and so on. Now, platforms can also do things to increase the cost of being out of the market, right? They can integrate — for example, they introduced a messaging feature to Instagram. So, perhaps you were like, “I don’t want to be on Instagram because I don’t like that.” But now if all my friends are communicating on Instagram, that increases the cost for me to stay out of Instagram because I can’t even communicate with my friends. So by integrating with features that increase the cost of not being on the platform, you might be pulling more people in, even though they might not like the product.\nnetwork effects | the paradox of modern connectivity And the talking about economic of scale and network effects never seems to becomes a cliché topic. The paradox of modern connectivity–while platforms like Instagram and TikTok are engineered for engagement and popularity, this ever-expanding network also traps us.\nThis calls for upgrades in regulatory frameworks and challenges facing platform designers: how to balance growth and network benefits against the genuine well-being of users. As we navigate these digital landscapes, it becomes imperative to critically evaluate not only how we engage with social media but also the broader societal norms and structures that these platforms reinforce and exploit. In doing so, we may find paths towards more sustainable and fulfilling interactions in our increasingly online lives.\n","permalink":"/posts/paradox_connectivity/","summary":"Are You Caught in a Social Media Trap?

The hosts, Youngme Moon, Mihir Desai, and Felix Oberholzer-Gee, unpacked the implications of large corporations\u0026rsquo; market behaviors and the (possibly waning) effectiveness of antitrust as a regulatory mechanism.\nTheir conversation feels easygoing yet surprisingly rich with insights, perfectly embodying an \u0026ldquo;After Hours\u0026rdquo; vibe. It\u0026rsquo;s the perfect podcast to relax with at night—each discussion is like a nugget of wisdom that\u0026rsquo;s both enjoyable and thought-provoking.\nsurprise! in the age of the internet To begin with, decades ago at the dawn of the age of the internet, people thought that the new information technology will finally makes the perfect competition tale come true. Felix said in the podcast:\n[Felix] You remember the day when we all thought that the internet would lead to a super competitive economy. Very difficult to make money because consumers know everything, they know all the products and all the prices.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s as if the economics textbook has come alive. Competition would flourish.\u0026quot;\nBut the joke\u0026rsquo;s on us, or at least the antitrust regulatory authorities:\n[Felix] And now, in a way, the opposite seems to have happened. Instead of getting sort of this competition between many, many, many companies, we get these gigantic companies.\nThere’s a concern that antitrust laws may not be fully equipped to handle modern mega-corporations that leverage scale to dominate markets, potentially leading to higher prices and less innovation. And worst, we\u0026rsquo;re still on the doorstep of these giant palaces of the unmeasurables of this new economy.\nFor example, these concentrated businesses\u0026rsquo; effect on wages\n[Felix] And I think the reason I\u0026rsquo;m less sure about [antitrust] it is, one, obviously in the most seemingly anti-competitive places like high tech, wages are blowing through the roof. So it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly clear that that simple story holds up. And then second, I think there are other things going on with wages. So I guess in general, this is like one of those questions where I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m not exercised enough about it. Maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t understand exactly what the drama is.\u0026quot;\nnetwork effect But the prophecy isn\u0026rsquo;t entirely incorrect–competition does become fiercer.\n[Youngme] As consumers, we have access to more companies than ever before. In other words, the competitive space in just about every industry seems to have gotten more crowded. So there\u0026rsquo;s more choice, prices have come down, there\u0026rsquo;s more information symmetry, all the things that you would want in an environment like this.\nAlas–the network effect. Uber, instagram, facebook–the more their user, the more attractive these companies\u0026rsquo; products becomes. Growth of popularity then leads to more control over the market, so they become bigger and bigger in such feedback loop.\nThe matter becomes more scary when one takes into account of merger and acquirement. The challenges faced by emerging companies like Snapchat in a market dominated by large tech giants, where decisions about mergers and acquisitions can significantly impact their survival and growth:\n[Youngme] Snapchat is a great example. Snapchat had an opportunity to do that [sell themselves to one of the big players]. And there\u0026rsquo;s this existential moment when they have to decide, do I continue to try to go it alone?\nSo Instagram decided to sell to Facebook. YouTube sold to Google. Snapchat decided to go it alone. And it\u0026rsquo;s having a hell of a time because it is competing in a market where there are so many benefits associated to scale on the consumer side that it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to sustain itself. Twitter\u0026rsquo;s having the same problem.\nwho is the product anyway? The traditional paradigm of product market, where on one side we have the firms offering products and the other side consumers make purchases. The structure is different\n[Felix] So there\u0026rsquo;s that old saying that if you\u0026rsquo;re getting a service that feels like it\u0026rsquo;s free, then you\u0026rsquo;re the product.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s essentially what all of these companies are doing. So they are owning the relationship with you. You\u0026rsquo;re getting very low prices. You\u0026rsquo;re getting a huge amount of benefit. But as a result of owning that relationship, they can then turn around and they can take advantage of everybody else on the other side of that business model. And as a result of having this sort of inverted business model, they can expand into any new vertical they want. They can essentially circumvent all antitrust laws.\nconclusion The dialogue on antitrust must evolve to address these complexities, considering not only the immediate effects on prices and consumer welfare but also the richer structure of the internet economy, that these tech giants raises broader impacts on innovation, market entry, and labor conditions.\nMoving forward, policymakers, businesses, and consumers alike will need to engage in more nuanced discussions and possibly reframe antitrust laws to better suit the realities of a digital, interconnected economy. This ongoing conversation is crucial as we navigate the fine line between fostering healthy competition and preventing market dominance that can stifle economic diversity and innovation.\n","permalink":"/posts/antitrust_mega_tech_companies/","summary":"Antitrust and Big Tech, and Is Corporate Lobbying A Good or Bad Thing?

Viscusi, Joseph Harrington Jr. and David Sappington\nChapter 3 Introduction of Antitrust | Reading Write-Ups\nIntroduction: The Value of Studying Antitrust The essence of economics vibrates with the spirit of competition. While not utterly unconstrained—no, firms can\u0026rsquo;t simply dynamite their competitors\u0026rsquo; facilities—we lean on competition as the quintessential engine driving favorable economic outcomes. But sometimes competition evaporates. Essentially, antitrust laws strive to enhance market functionality by nurturing and regulating competition.\nMonopoly versus Competition: An Illustrative Example Recall the theoretical world of perfect competition in Econ101, where\nConsumers are perfectly informed about all goods, all of which are private goods. Producers have production functions that rule out increasing returns to scale and technological change. Consumers maximize utility given budget constraints as defined by their income and product prices; producers maximize profits given their production functions and input prices. All agents are price takers, and externalities among agents are ruled out. A competitive equilibrium, which is a collection of prices such that all markets clear, is then determined. Under these conditions, competitive equilibrium ensures prices equal marginal costs, maximizing total welfare (consumer surplus plus firm revenue).\nNow, envisage a shift to a singular monopolistic producer. This monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve and chooses prices to maximize revenue, resulting in prices higher than those in competitive markets.\nThis example, while simplified, underscores the essence of monopoly dynamics—the optimal market outcome for welfare, a competitive equilibrium, is subverted by monopolistic pricing strategies that favor the producer at the expense of overall welfare.\nHowever, let\u0026rsquo;s not hastily conclude that \u0026ldquo;more competition is always better.\u0026rdquo; We are merely scratching the surface of this complex topic, as the upcoming chapters will reveal.\nWhen Assumptions Relax: Unveiling Complications Economies of Scale: The initial assumption negates the impact of economies of scale—envisioning that replacing a monopolist with numerous firms has no cost implications. In reality, industries like telecommunications or large-scale manufacturing demonstrate that sometimes, a single producer can be most cost-effective.\nX-Inefficiency: Monopolies, luxuriating in their market power, may not always pursue optimal strategies. Nobel Laureate Sir John Hicks humorously noted that\nThe best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life.\nhinting at the complacency that can arise from unchallenged market dominance. This phenomenon is further exacerbated by potential misalignments between ownership and managerial goals, not unlike the operational ethos of some sports franchise owners.\nMonopoly-Induced Waste:\nAnother source of inefficiency created by monopoly is competition among agents to become a monopolist. Rent-seeking behavior may arise in various ways: lobbying activities use up real resources, excessive advertising campaigns, unions, etc..\nNotably, innovation creates monopoly sometimes. But the nature of innovation lowers cost and might benefit market even if it induces monopoly. Taking into account of the dynamtic nature of the economy, it further complicates our analysis.\nTool Box: Industrial Organization The field of industrial organization began with research by economists at Harvard University in the 1930s and 1940s. They developed a general approach to the economic analysis of markets that is based on three key concepts: (1) structure, (2) conduct (or behavior), and (3) performance. They hypothesized a causal relationship between these three concepts: Structure (number of sellers, ease of entry, etc.) determines firm conduct (pricing, advertising, etc.), which then determines market performance (efficiency, innovation). For example, more firms (structure) result in more intense price competition (conduct) which yields higher consumer surplus and lower industry profit (performance) because of lower prices. Known as the structure-conduct-performance paradigm (SCPP):\nthe structure-conduct-performance paradigm, though stylized, it provides a framework to start. Although the causal narrative of the SCPP framework appears overly simplistic, and the framework itself no longer underpins the theoretical and empirical pursuits in industrial organization, the concepts of structure, conduct, and performance still provide a valuable framework for understanding market dynamics. These elements help define the market range, for instance, from flight routes between specific cities to broader national markets. They also aid in understanding market structure, including factors like the proportion, concentration, and diversity of the industry, and market power which involves aspects like consumer demand functions. Conduct, or the actions taken by firms, and performance objectives, such as welfare, efficiency, or broader economic performance standards like product quality, variety, and service levels, are also integral. Lastly, regulatory authorities—the government or courts—play a crucial role in influencing the market dynamics that Adam Smith’s invisible hand would otherwise guide unfettered.\nA Bit More History During the 1950s and 1960s, empirical research under the SCPP framework aimed to identify uniform relationships applicable across all industries, such as the effect of additional firms on lowering prices. However, experience has shown that each industry’s idiosyncrasies make it impractical to apply a one-size-fits-all approach. Today, industrial organization economists recognize the unique characteristics of each industry, moving away from overarching generalizations.\nGovernment The \u0026ldquo;Government Policy\u0026rdquo; segment of the SCPP highlights how antitrust and regulation can influence the structure and conduct of industries to impact their economic performance.\nRegulatory bodies identify and curb anti-competitive behaviors through various means—be it fines, remedies, or more dramatic actions like incarcerating CEOs. The interplay between firms and regulators is a complex dance:\n[Nobel laureate] Ronald [Coase] said he had gotten tired of antitrust because when the prices went up the judges said it was monopoly, when the prices went down they said it was predatory pricing, and when they stayed the same they said it was tacit collusion.\nWhile Professor Coase was presumably speaking in satiric hyperbole, there is some truth in what he says. The challenge of antitrust is to distinguish anticompetitive behavior, such as collusion and monopolization, from competition and the exercise of fairly obtained monopoly power (for example, due to better products).\nOn the Purpose and Design of Antitrust Laws: Some More History Historically, antitrust laws were not solely aimed at maximizing social welfare or consumer surplus:\nThe purpose of antitrust (or competition) law is to maintain a competitive marketplace by prohibiting certain practices that allow a firm or firms to create, enhance, or extend market power. To begin, an important distinction needs to be drawn between protecting competition and protecting competitors. In the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, a goal of antitrust law was interpreted as protecting small businesses, often to the detriment of consumers. This perspective is attributed to the Supreme Court of Earl Warren (1953–1969) which defined “competitive” as when the market has many small firms that can effectively compete with large firms. This meant, for example, that a merger that lowered cost and benefited consumers by lowering price could be prohibited, because it harmed small firms by causing them to be at a cost disadvantage.\nThis view of the role of U.S. antitrust radically changed during the 1970s and 1980s. The Chicago School revolution shifted the focus to protecting consumers, not small businesses. More competition was supposed to mean lower prices, higher output, and more innovation. Out of this new perspective emerged the standard of consumer welfare: If consumers are made worse off then the practice is to be prohibited. Otherwise, it is to be allowed.\nU.S. and Global Community Antitrust enforcement typically occurs at national or state levels, and how governments interact with market sectors varies considerably across countries due to differences in government structures, legal systems, geographical and historical factors. The U.S. and Canada share some similarities in their approaches, while European nations have distinct systems. In Asia, particularly China, practices vary significantly. It is crucial to appreciate these differences, as they enrich our understanding of global economic dynamics.\nConclusion As we step into the era of AI, antitrust, a field steeped in traditional economic analysis, is poised to gain renewed relevance and interest. The discipline of economics, known for its deliberate pace compared to fields like computer vision, benefits from its methodical rigor. Its foundational theories are well-established, having stood the test of time and rigorous peer review. Moreover, many topics remain ripe for exploration, promising a rich field of study as we integrate traditional economic principles with the challenges of modern technology.\n","permalink":"/posts/antitrust_introduction/","summary":"ECONOMICS OF REGULATION AND ANTITRUST by W.

This piece, while masquerading as a beginner\u0026rsquo;s practice piece, demands a profound understanding of its delicate complexities and the composer\u0026rsquo;s intentions.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s one thing to hit the right keys at the right moment; it\u0026rsquo;s entirely another to perform Mozart with the depth and nuance the music deserves. In this realm, Grigory Sokolov\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of the Sonata Facile shines exceptionally bright. Renowned for his commitment to live performances over studio recordings, Sokolov brings a raw, unfiltered authenticity to his music.\nWatch Sokolov live in action at the Auditorium Giovanni Agnelli del Lingotto, Turin, 2017, performing the \u0026ldquo;Sonata facile\u0026rdquo;: I. Allegro\nIn this performance, Sokolov captures the innate simplicity and innocence of the Sonata, yet enriches it with a chromatic beauty that only a master could evoke. His delicate yet powerful execution showcases an outstanding control that transforms technical proficiency into a display of ease and freedom. It\u0026rsquo;s a reminder that the true challenge of this \u0026ldquo;Sonata Facile\u0026rdquo; lies not in the notes themselves, but in the expressiveness with which they are delivered.\n","permalink":"/posts/grigory_sokolov/","summary":"Welcome to our holiday music series!

Here\u0026rsquo;s a background of the topic, summary of the talk and their work (hopefully), and some discussion afterwards.\nRegulation of Algorithmic Collusion ABSTRACT\nConsider sellers in a competitive market that use algorithms to adapt their prices from data that they collect. In such a context it is plausible that algorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices and this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.e., the buyers in the market). This paper gives a definition of plausible algorithmic non-collusion for pricing algorithms. The definition allows a regulator to empirically audit algorithms by applying a statistical test to the data that they collect. Algorithms that are good, i.e., approximately optimize prices to market conditions, can be augmented to contain the data sufficient to pass the audit. Algorithms that have colluded on, e.g., supra-competitive prices cannot pass the audit. The definition allows sellers to possess useful side information that may be correlated with supply and demand and could affect the prices used by good algorithms. The paper provides an analysis of the statistical complexity of such an audit, i.e., how much data is sufficient for the test of non-collusion to be accurate.\nalgorithmic collusion The concept of algorithmic collusion is brought to light by Calvano et al. in their seminal 2020 paper from the American Economic Review, \u0026ldquo;Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmic Pricing, and Collusion.\u0026rdquo; They note that:\nAs firms increasingly adopt software programs for pricing goods and services—a trend evidenced by over a third of vendors automating their pricing on Amazon in 2015—pricing algorithms might autonomously learn to collude. This tacit collusion occurs without explicit instructions or inter-algorithm communication, challenging the current frameworks of antitrust policies which target explicit agreements among competitors.\nThe paper substantiates through simulation experiments that even simple pricing algorithms can systematically adopt collusive strategies. These strategies, markedly sustaining prices below monopoly levels but well above the Bertrand competition equilibrium, rely on punishments for defections, which are finite and gradually revert to pre-deviation pricing. This suggests a form of coordination absent any formal agreement.\nFurther studies enhancing our understanding of this phenomenon include:\n\u0026ldquo;Artificial Intelligence and Auction Design\u0026rdquo; by Banchio and Skrzypacz (EC'22) \u0026ldquo;The Impact of AI Design on Pricing\u0026rdquo; by Asker et al. (AEMS'23) \u0026ldquo;Algorithm Collusion by LLMs\u0026rdquo; by Fish et al. (2024) \u0026ldquo;Algorithmic Pricing and Competition: Empirical Evidence from the German Retail Gasoline Market\u0026rdquo; by Assad et al. (JPE'24) the talk | Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion Addressing algorithmic collusion involves navigating the fine line between legitimate competitive strategies and illicit coordination. Proposing a certification for non-collusive behavior might provide a clearer path than directly defining collusion, which can be a slippery slope due to potential misclassifications. Such a certification could have properties that:\nAre unilateral, focusing on the absence of joint behaviors. Allow for the use of correlated side information, such as price adjustments of hotels in response to demand fluctuations during holidays. Define that optimizing responses based on market conditions is not collusion. Are verifiable through historical data analysis. Simplify algorithmic verification processes. The framework utilize calibrated (swap) regret to assess whether a change in pricing strategies would improve a seller\u0026rsquo;s long-term outcomes. If no benefit is derived from altering prices, then the current pricing strategy might be deemed non-collusive. The development of a statistical test and accompanying algorithm to analyze a seller’s historical pricing and sales data can determine compliance with these non-collusion standards, despite challenges such as data gaps which might necessitate assumptions and imputation methods.\ndiscussions Creating mechanisms to detect and define non-collusive behavior in algorithm-driven markets is fraught with challenges, both conceptual and technical. In an algorithmic setting, what constitutes collusion isn\u0026rsquo;t always clear-cut. For instance, algorithms may evolve to adopt pricing strategies that, while not explicitly collusive, result in prices that are consistently above competitive levels due to optimal long-term strategies. These outcomes, while potentially resembling collusive arrangements, do not meet the traditional criteria of collusion but indicate a persistent elevation of price levels.\nThis ambiguity, compounded by the opaque nature of algorithms, makes validating the presence or absence of collusion not just an algorithmic challenge but a conceptual dilemma as well—prompting us to question: Where do we draw the line for collusion? Or indeed, does such a line even exist?\n","permalink":"/posts/regulating_algorithmic_collusion/","summary":"This week, Chenhao Zhang from Northwestern University visited ITCS and gave a talk on Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion, based on his ongoing collaboration with Prof. Jason Hartline.

Each narrative underscores the immense influence of stardom and its complex interplay with the music industry’s mechanics.\nMusic, inherently a personal form of art and enjoyment, has no right or wrong when it comes to individual taste. However, an unbiased approach is crucial when studying the music industry. As we conclude this series, we focus on the curse of popularity—how Taylor Swift\u0026rsquo;s omnipresence might have unintentionally reshaped the entertainment landscape, revealing the double-edged sword of excessive public attention.\nA Scholarly Serenade? Taylor Swift\u0026rsquo;s influence has undeniably extended beyond music, sparking academic interest that culminated in Swiftposium 2024, a conference ostensibly dedicated to exploring her impact on various cultural and societal dimensions. The event, organized by scholars from six universities across Australia and New Zealand, promised an intellectual examination of Swift\u0026rsquo;s role as a cultural icon.\nWhile the conference undoubtedly highlights the breadth of Swift\u0026rsquo;s impact, one might ponder the depth of these academic inquiries. Are these discussions a robust exploration of cultural phenomena or merely an academic veneer for fan admiration? The enthusiasm of the scholars, while infectious, occasionally seemed to mirror the fervor of fandom rather than the dispassionate analysis one might expect from a scholarly gathering.\nExistentialist’s Authenticity? The discourse around Swift\u0026rsquo;s authenticity, particularly in papers like \u0026lsquo;ANTI-HERO\u0026rsquo;: A PHILOSOPHICAL TAKE ON TAYLOR’S EXISTENTIAL AUTHENTICITY, ventures into philosophical territory. The notion posited—that Swift’s interaction with fans via social media enhances their existential freedom—bears the hallmarks of academic ingenuity, yet one cannot help but question the underlying motivations.\nThe term \u0026lsquo;authenticity\u0026rsquo; here is wielded with a liberality that might perplex philosophers of yore. Swift’s approach to fan engagement—giving out tour tickets, exclusive photos, and snippets of her life—certainly crafts a persona of accessibility and intimacy. However, as astutely observed by the author:\n\u0026ldquo;In today’s digital age, considering the ‘authenticity’ of a celebrity is a tricky, subjective issue.\nSo while it may look authentic on the surface, it runs the risk of treating a fan as a means-to-an-end, rather than an autonomous ‘for itself’.\u0026rdquo;\nThis critique subtly hints at the commodification underlying such interactions, where the line between genuine engagement and strategic marketing blurs. Swift\u0026rsquo;s narrative of authenticity and existential freedom could, to the cynical eye, appear as a sophisticated form of brand management dressed in academic garb.\nExcess Breeds Calamity Taylor Swift\u0026rsquo;s phenomenal reach has sometimes overshadowed other significant aspects of the musical world. To name one, the blurring line between art and artist compels us to consume not just her music but her persona:\n\u0026ldquo;The distinction between art and artist is blurred here; to consume Taylor\u0026rsquo;s music is to consume Taylor herself. This includes empathizing with her life\u0026rsquo;s details as well as confronting the manipulation, the whitewashing, and the narrow-mindedness. How people feel about Taylor\u0026rsquo;s music largely depends on their own state of mind at the time.\u0026rdquo;\nAnna Ge.\nToday, viral internet fame often takes precedence over musical talent, with public exposure becoming a more significant success metric than traditional record.

What has recently made the topic into major news is that Taylor Swift has discussed her torrid experience in the industry. The pop star has a long record of challenging the powers that be, and while her latest battle is unlikely to end in victory, she has shone a light on one of the less understood aspects of how artists and record labels interact.\nAt the heart of Ms. Swift\u0026rsquo;s discontent is the sale of her master recordings, which now fall into the hands of someone she neither likes nor trusts. This saga began when she was just 15, signing away her masters for the chance at fame.\nThe gist of Ms Swift’s complaint, which she posted on social media on June 30th, is that someone she does not like or trust is taking ownership of her master recordings—the tapes or digital files from which albums are pressed and released—and they are free to do with them as they please. Ms Swift was 15 when she signed to Big Machine, an independent label set up by Scott Borchetta in 2005. Her contract ceded ownership of her masters to the label.\nRecord labels argue that owning the masters is necessary to recoup their investment. They liken themselves to pharmaceutical companies, which spend fortunes on research and development, knowing that many projects won\u0026rsquo;t pan out. This model is not without its controversies, as it often leaves artists feeling estranged from their own creations.\nA label owning an artist’s master recordings is commonplace. Record companies operate in a similar way to pharmaceutical companies. Both spend fortunes on research and development, and in both cases most of the expenditure does not result in revenue. Pharma companies patent their drugs so they can make the money that feeds future research. Similarly, labels own recordings in exchange for the investment they have made not just in that artist—it can cost up to $1m to take an act from signing to their first release, with no guarantee of a hit—but also to fund new artists, of whom between one in four and one in ten will become successful.\nWhile some artists manage to negotiate terms to retain or eventually reclaim their masters, the majority find themselves in a perpetual struggle for control over their music, underscoring the imbalance of power inherent in the industry.\nOften, powerful artists will regain control of their masters. When a contract is due to expire, a label might offer ownership of past recordings as an incentive to sign a new one. But not always: Prince became The Artist Formerly Known as Prince in protest at Warner Brothers’ ownership of his recordings, and his catalogue is now bafflingly split: Warner owns everything released before 1996, Sony everything after.\nIn wrapping up our discussion, the situation is layered with complexities that extend far beyond the superficial narrative of artists versus corporate giants. Record labels indeed guard their investments fiercely. As for Taylor Swift, her vocal battles against industry norms serve both as a beacon for artist rights and a clever maneuver within her own narrative of personal and creative autonomy.\nMs Swift’s distrust of Mr Braun appears to be as much personal as professional. As she is one of the biggest pop stars around, there is plenty of incentive for Mr Braun to try to generate as much revenue as possible from her Big Machine recordings, from which Ms Swift will continue to receive her contractual share. Still, all this is not quite as simple as the Big Bad Music Industry exploiting the poor, innocent artist. If it were, then no one would ever sign away their masters—but they do.\nThis tussle over master recordings, often dramatized as a clear-cut case of artistic victimhood, subtly underscores the sophisticated dance of interests that defines the music business. Swift’s narrative isn’t merely about loss and recovery; it’s a finely-tuned performance in personal branding within the complex concert of industry economics. As the lines between business decisions and personal battles blur, we find a narrative rich with strategy, emotion, and, yes, a touch of theatricality—a reminder that in the music industry, the show always goes on, both on and off stage.\n","permalink":"/posts/mastering_her_own_disaster/","summary":"The Tug-of-War Over Master Recordings - Taylor Swift\u0026rsquo;s battle over her early music illuminates the complex dynamics of the music industry Taylor Swift\u0026rsquo;s recent outcry over the control of her early masters highlights a lesser-known, yet crucial aspect of the music business: the power dynamics between artists and record labels.\nIn the history of the music business, many artists have not had control over their own careers.

She reigns in commercial success, but creatively?\nTaylor swift has a strong claim to being the most popular entertainer of the 21st century—and perhaps of all time. Five of the ten most popular albums in America in 2023 were hers, according to Luminate, an analytics firm. Ms Swift’s albums have now cumulatively racked up 384 weeks in the top ten of the Billboard chart, beating a record previously held by the Beatles. She is halfway through the most lucrative concert tour ever. A film version of it grossed over $260m at the box office last year.\nYet, the more famous one gets, the more likely they are to trip over their own spotlight. Releasing a hefty 31-track album surely keeps her at the center of attention, albeit briefly.\nOn April 19th she released a double album entitled “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology”. Over the course of 31 songs, Ms Swift wields her scalpel and dissects every inch of her recent relationships.\nHowever, the vast streaming numbers and enthusiastic sales have been marred by critics describing the album as surprisingly juvenile and crudely unpolished.\nIs Ms Swift falling into the trap that ensnares those who reach the highest echelons of their fields, from auteurs to chief executives? Perhaps no one—including her songwriting collaborators—wants to tell music’s biggest star that her tunes are bland.\nOn “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart” she boasts that she is “so productive, it’s an art”. Indeed it is quite common for great artists at the height of their fame to release lengthy double albums: think of the Beatles’ 30 songs on the “White Album” or Bruce Springsteen’s 20 on “The River”. But both of those could have benefited from more selective editing and still have become the treasured classics that they are today. For Ms Swift, it is the quality of her output, not the quantity, that has set her apart from her peers.\nTaylor Swift seems to lament the intense scrutiny, which, paradoxically, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t shy away from.

It covers detailed aspects of how platform\u0026rsquo;s design boosted user participation as well as misaligned incentives for growing amount of low-quality posts.\nThe Little Red Book (Xiaohongshu) has become an intriguing product, increasingly popular among my peers. Many young colleagues in my company have turned to it for advice on various topics. Whether it’s choosing a beginner hiking route, finding a cost-effective hospital for wisdom teeth extraction, or debating whether to add sugar to scrambled eggs with tomatoes, Xiaohongshu is their go-to resource.\nGenerally, people favor Xiaohongshu over ChatGPT as a life consultant because it provides richer life experiences. As you might have noticed, ChatGPT tends to be overly logical, often offering extensive, verbatim lists of suggestions. Xiaohongshu has achieved high user engagement by lowering barriers for content creators, tailoring its recommendation algorithms to favor smaller creators, and transforming comment sections into content. These efforts have paid off, though not without costs:\nCore Demand of Xiaohongshu: Beyond short video entertainment, users crave content based on real-life experiences. Experience, with its subjective nature, often holds more value than objective knowledge. This premise underlies Xiaohongshu\u0026rsquo;s popularity—it provides useful, searchable personal insights. Popularity Beyond Algorithms: While the recommender system plays a significant role in the success of platforms like Xiaohongshu and Jitterbug, another critical factor is their ability to lower content production costs. As of early 2023, Xiaohongshu boasted 260 million active monthly users, with creators making up 7%. This significant creator engagement is a testament to its accessible content creation tools. Accessibility of Content Creation: Xiaohongshu simplifies content creation by emphasizing visuals over text. Users don\u0026rsquo;t need advanced writing skills; basic photo-taking and simple editing suffice. This lower barrier to entry mirrors Jitterbug’s approach, both platforms significantly reducing the cost of content production. Simplified Editing Tools: Xiaohongshu’s editor is intentionally basic, lacking features like bold text, color changes, or font customization. This simplicity is by design, aimed at reducing production costs and keeping the focus on easy content creation. Innovative Editing Features: Xiaohongshu integrates unique features like \u0026ldquo;text-to-image\u0026rdquo; capabilities, allowing users to transform text into styled images, further easing the content creation process. Shift in Content Consumption: Content on Xiaohongshu, particularly in tech, is not only abundant but engaging and interactive, often generating better engagement than other platforms. This suggests a migration of users’ content consumption habits towards more dynamic and community-interactive platforms. Comments as Content: Xiaohongshu capitalizes on the concept of \u0026lsquo;comments as content\u0026rsquo;. Simple posts can generate hundreds of comments, which themselves become a form of content, lowering the threshold for creating engaging material. Cultural Expressions and Trends: Common expressions like \u0026ldquo;ah ah ah ah ah!!\u0026rdquo; reflect a cultural trend on Xiaohongshu towards exaggerated emotions, often used to grab attention in a sea of content. Challenges with Clickbait: The necessity for eye-catching titles is understandable from a content producer\u0026rsquo;s perspective. However, the platform\u0026rsquo;s lack of action against or encouragement of sensationalist titles risks damaging its community culture over time. Support for Emerging Bloggers: Xiaohongshu\u0026rsquo;s recommendation system aims to support bloggers with fewer than 1,000 fans, helping prevent a Matthew effect. However, for content creators, the reliance on this system for content visibility can feel daunting. Xiaohongshu\u0026rsquo;s appeal is broadening, attracting not just a female audience but an increasing number of male users as well. Many of my male friends use the app to look up gym tutorials or find hospital recommendations–yes, the platform’s location-based recommendations make it easy to access relevant information tailored to one\u0026rsquo;s local community. Interestingly, it has also become a space where some boys browse for images of sexy girls, cleverly training the algorithm to cater to their preferences in a platform originally designed for shopping and sharing product experiences, so that you can imagine that those images are abundant in supply compared to other men-extensive platforms such as Hu Pu (a sport-game comment platform that one can imagine is almost dominated by boys).\nIt looks like Little Red Book has a page for everyone.

Conventionally, control $0$ refers to freezing the state (taking no action, eg. not reading the paper) hence no reward is obtained, while control $1$ corresponds to the \u0026lsquo;continuation control\u0026rsquo; (i.e. reading the paper) that yields reward $r(x_t)$ and triggers state transition to $y$ according to probability $P(y|x_t)$. A policy is any (possibly randomized) rule that for each decision time $t$, specifies the control ${0, 1}$ to be applied as a function of $t$, $x_t$ (the state at time $t$), the set of previous decisions and states. The most general policy that relies on all historical information but not the future ones is past- measurable. A policy which maximizes the expected total reward over the set of all policies for every initial state will be termed an optimal policy. Deterministic policies are those which involve no randomization. Stationary policies are those which involve no explicit time dependence. Markov policies are those for which the control chosen at time t depends only on $t$ and the state at time $t$. As for reward, it\u0026rsquo;s defined as the summation of discounted rewards over time, of course, viewed from period $t = 1$ at the beginning: $$ \\mathbb E \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} a^t r(x_t) $$ Now consider a decision problem with $n$ available independent bandit processes $B_1, . . . , B_n$. The state of the decision process is the vector of states $ξ = (ξ_1,\u0026hellip;,ξ_n)$ and is a member of the product space $E = E_1 \\times \\cdots \\times E_n$. If at decision time $t$ we choose to apply the continuation control to $B_i$, which is in state $ξ_i$, then a reward $r_i(ξ_i)$ is obtained from it. Standard dynamic programming gives us the solution over all past-mesuarable policies $\\pi$: $$ \\begin{align} V(\\xi) \u0026amp; = \\sup_{\\pi}\\mathbb E\\left[ \\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty a^t r_{i_t}(\\xi_{i_t}(t)) \\bigg | \\xi(0) = \\xi \\right]\\cr \u0026amp; = \\max_{i\\in [n]}{r_i(\\xi_i) + a\\sum_{y\\in E_i}P_i(y|\\xi_i)V(y, \\xi_{-i})} \\end{align} $$ btw, $\\xi_{-i} = [\\xi_1, \\ldots, \\xi_{i - 1}, \\xi_{i + 1}, \\ldots, \\xi_n]$. And the above process, unfortunately, is computationally infeasible for even moderate sizes of $|E|$ and $n$​.\n\u0026mdash; stay tuned for next episode - Gittin\u0026rsquo;s index.\n","permalink":"/posts/bandits/","summary":"Consider a decision problem where you have a collection of $\\mathcal L$ papers to read before your next week\u0026rsquo;s meeting with your advisor.

At the beginning, critics were almost harsh on this new-born style, almost being denounced as obscure, said the critic Louis Leroy in his scathing review of the exhibition for the satirical newspaper La Charivari: he wrote that, \u0026lsquo;a wallpaper in its embryonic state is more complete\u0026rsquo; than Monet\u0026rsquo;s seascape.\nThe first exhibition to feature Impressionist painting took place at the former Paris studio of the famed photographer Nadar, who offered his space at 35 Boulevard des Capucines to a group of artists looking to show their work to the public.\nThat group, which included Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas and Paul Cezanne, would boldly challenge the tradition of European painting and change the course of art history. On 15 April 1874, they debuted the Première Exposition of the Société Anonyme, presenting paintings that privileged colour, the movement of light, and spontaneous views of contemporary life. It became known as the First Impressionist Exhibition, after the critic Louis Leroy’s notorious indictment of the exhibition as mere ‘impressions’, and is widely seen as the birthplace of modern art.\nreject, reject, reject. Notably, the Salon des Refusés was almost designed for impressionism paintings–or all avant-garde paintings that got rejected by the academy.\nThroughout the 1860s and 1870s, the work of the Impressionists and other pathbreaking artists was frequently rejected by the prestigious Salon de Paris, the annual art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, whose jurors favoured the idealised, ‘finished’ compositions and muted colour palette of academic painting. In 1863 when the Salon refused two thirds of its submissions, Emperor Napoleon III said that the rejected works deserved to be seen by the public and established the Salon des Refusés, where controversial paintings by Manet, Whistler and others made waves.\nBtw, this Salon des Refuses reminded me of an episode of Freakonomics How to Succeed at Failing–where the host mentioned an interesting idea of a section in academia people\u0026rsquo;s CV of unsuccessful projects: failed fundings, rejected manuscripts and even traumatized careers. As well as an idea inspired by my flute teacher, almost be like:\nBehind one successful milestone of innovation, like the Debussy\u0026rsquo;s ephemeral fantasies, there are countless unrecognized efforts. It is somehow vital to tolerate or even appreciate non-perfect, yet-seemingly-absurd avant-garde art works. Otherwise everything just\u0026hellip; stays there.\ngame of the light, and shadows Impressionism was speaking against the seriousness of the art that came before, refuting their over-emphasize on realistic rendering of scenes.\nThrough dramatic angles and a focus on light and saturated hues, the Impressionists captured the ethereal drama of fleeting moments and brought French painting into the present tense. Trading traditional linear perspective and modelling for loose brushwork and daubs of colour, their approach offered a provocative invitation to encounter the canvas as a surface.\nClaude Monet (1840-1926) La Roche Guibel, Port-Domois, 1886.

But it\u0026rsquo;s not only about a new attitude on canvas. Impressionism changed the way of how paintings were made and for whom it shall pay attention to.\nThe Impressionists’ unique style owes much to their insistence on painting outside of the studio. While previously artists often began a landscape outdoors and completed it later, painters like Monet, Renoir and Alfred Sisley worked on canvases from start to finish without returning to their studios, en plein air, as it was known.\nOther factors contributes and constitutes Impressionism\u0026rsquo;s development and core ethic. Immersed as they were in the rich cultural scene of Paris in the late 19th century, the Impressionists maintained a particularly strong connection to the literary sphere of the time. New techonologies (trains, metal tubes to store paints) changed how and where paintings were made.\njokes on you During the earliest time (around the late 1800s), challenges then for the Impressionists were lack of fundings. The world doesn\u0026rsquo;t change much–without the art academy’s endorsement, even Monet and Renoir lived in poverty. In general, the Impressionists mostly rely on individual patrons. But, things changes\nSince that intrepid first exhibition 150 years ago, Impressionism remains one of the most influential art movements of all time. The Impressionists shattered the aesthetic norms of the time, while their dealers and supporters dismantled the system that had cast them out.\nImpressionism marked the great first step toward pure abstraction, something which was unfathomable prior to them.\nClaude Monet (1840-1926), Saint-Georges Majeur, 1908.

Standing on the shoulder of the braves, Fauvism, Expressionism ventured their way. Later on Surrealism, Dadaism and Abstract Expressioned marched onto claiming the market.\nThe legacy of the Impressionists continues to make waves, having inspired many early avant-garde movements and subsequent contemporary art styles through to the present. Those rebel artists of 1874 fundamentally changed the premise of art, prompting audiences to consider not just what we see but how we see the world around us.\n","permalink":"/posts/monet_on_sale/","summary":"Christie\u0026rsquo;s latest story Everything you need to know about Impressionism: how a group of rebel artists \u0026lsquo;freed painting\u0026rsquo; offered a thorough, concise and informative introduction of the origin of impressionism.

When there isn\u0026rsquo;t a ground truth but exists multiple conflicting believes, how influencial voices speak become a tricky issue.\nMaybe, this reflects that information design should not merely be about persuasion over perfectly rational utility maximizers. At least in this very case, it\u0026rsquo;s about managing aggregated emotions (fury, in this case) as well as the game-changing popularity that distorted opinions to an unprecedented extent. Treating the review just as a scalar that reflects a reviewer\u0026rsquo;s conflicting opinion that deviated from the floating expectation of her most enthusiastic fan base is somewhat insufficient in capturing the nuance in maneuvering public opinion.\nTo begin with, first it is important to bear in mind that in modern music industry, pop singers are characters built by the artist representing him/her, as well as producers, writers, musicians and engineers and public relation teams, and most importantly, under their operating managers and for their labels. As the famous saying goes\nArt is Art. Everything else is everything else.\n–– Ad Reinhardt\nPopular music belongs to the latter collection–it transcends multi-faceted motives throughout its lifecycle: the artistic or career pursuit of the artist, the joint effort of the production team, the label\u0026rsquo;s incentive, push and compromises, to name a few. There is simply too many ugly issues well tangled and camouflaged behind a 3-minute hit. For example, for The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology that Swift maximally bloated with 15 (15!) additional songs. Fans cheer for such prolificus, as they interpret and reinterpret of the sheer quantity of clues and keywords over scrutiny of the lyrics–as if Swift would have us believe that this album represents an unprecedented level of access to her inner life. It\u0026rsquo;s not her fault though:\nThis data-dump release strategy is not at all unique to Swift; it’s a concession to the modern music economy, which incentivizes artists to batch as many songs as possible, in as many packages as possible, to juice streams and sales.\nIf the above is somehow straightforwardly true with a tender warning of the artist\u0026rsquo;s compromise, the true bomb of the review is remarkably courageous:\nIt’s not Swift’s fault that we’re so obsessed with her, but this album gives the impression that she can’t quite hear herself over the roar of the crowd. Tearjerkers like “So Long, London” and “loml” fall short when every lyric carries equal weight. There’s no hierarchy of tragic detail; these songs fail to distill an overarching emotional truth, tending to smother rather than sting. It would help if Swift were exploring new musical ideas, but she is largely retreading old territory—unsurprising, perhaps, given that the last three years of her life have been consumed by re-recording her old albums and touring her past selves. The new music is colored in familiar shades of Antonoff (sparse drum programming, twinkly synths) and Dessner (suppler, more strings). Songs sound like other songs—“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” like Midnights’ “Mastermind”; the intro of “So Long, London” like that of Folklore’s “My Tears Ricochet.” Her melodies feel staid, like they are made to fit the music, rather than the other way around.\nDespite recent criticism of Pitchfork getting soft and somewhat biased, it is still regarded as perhaps one of the most influential and professional voice in music. Music reviews are multi-faceted. Because evaluating a product (or, art, if you\u0026rsquo;d prefer) on a 0-10 scale is just unrealistic and impossible. Looking at its written reviews, one can find how the media and its reviewers carefully balance public opinion, personal bias as well as mere quality of the music so as to sustain reputation as well as lead the opinions. It\u0026rsquo;s delicate. But, what\u0026rsquo;s left though, at the end of the day when the bubbles fade out, is music.\n","permalink":"/posts/critics_say/","summary":"Three days following Taylor Swift\u0026rsquo;s release of her 31-track new album The Tortured Poets Department / The Anthology, Pitchfork released their reviews that rated 6.6 / 6 for the first and second half of the album, respectively.\nI believe writing the Pitchfork review of a Taylor Swift album should earn you the medal of freedom for your courage.\n–– Louie @DJLouieXIV, X\nSwifties quickly flooded the comment section under Pitchfork\u0026rsquo;s twitter post–speaking any slightest negativity unanonymously against the most passionate and gigantic fan base on earth requires extra courage and care.","title":"the critics arrive"},{"content":"Professor YaXiang Yuan recently graced SUFE with a compelling talk on Big Data \u0026amp; Optimization, masterfully engaging a diverse audience—from MBA students and enthusiastic undergrads to school leaders.

But his major concern is solid, that information design demands overly strong assumptions–the existence of a common prior, commitment of the signal sender, inference ability of the signal receiver–all poses challenges for direct applications that justify the existing theory. The real world should be something in between the perfectly rational Bayesian persuasion and the noisy cheap talks.\nNevertheless, my stance is decidedly more optimistic. The past decade has witness a boom of theoretical literature on information design, and that the field is more than ready to step into industry. Hence, information design in the age of internet-AI, interacting with the field of operational management and e-commerce would be promising. Quote Cadogan\u0026rsquo;s 2020 TutORials:\nGoing forward, it is important to focus on other relevant settings, carefully model the operational details, and discuss how firms/decision makers can optimally use information to induce a desired outcome.\nstanding on the shoulders of giants basic framework and technical variations Information design deals with influencing agents\u0026rsquo; actions by a designer (sender) who commits to a signaling mechanism that reveals payoff-relevant signals once a state is realized. The sender aims to maximize their own payoff by crafting these signals to induce specific actions from the agents (receivers).\nConcavification: This approach helps in understanding when and how the sender can use information as a lever to enhance their payoff by converting the payoff function into a concave shape. This simplifies the identification of optimal strategies and is derived from the Bayesian persuasion framework introduced by Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011). Revelation Principle and Bayes Nash Equilibrium (BNE): Similar to the revelation principle in mechanism design, straightforward signaling mechanisms recommend actions that are optimal for receivers to follow, ensuring the sender\u0026rsquo;s information shapes receivers\u0026rsquo; beliefs and actions correctly. This concept extends the work of Bergemann and Morris (2016) on Bayes correlated equilibria. Rothschild-Stiglitz Approach: Focuses on designing signals based solely on the expected impact (mean) on the receivers\u0026rsquo; actions, simplifying the design problem when the sender\u0026rsquo;s payoff depends on the actions taken by receivers. This approach is particularly useful in environments where the state affects payoffs through its expectation, as detailed in the work of Gentzkow and Kamenica (2017). Step Function Lemma and Tricks: Techniques used when the sender\u0026rsquo;s payoff can be segmented into distinct levels or \u0026lsquo;steps\u0026rsquo; based on different intervals of the state\u0026rsquo;s realization, facilitating piece-wise strategies in signal design to target specific outcomes effectively. This method leverages the tractability of convex optimization in information design, as explored by Candogan (2020). existing applications Queueing Systems: Information design can be employed to influence customers\u0026rsquo; decisions on whether to join queues based on signals about queue length, so as to help manage customer flow and optimize service efficiency. Lingenbrink and Iyer (2018) explore how a designer can reveal informative signals on the queue length to influence customers\u0026rsquo; decisions to join, with the objective of maximizing the revenue collected from customers who decide to participate. Revenue Management: Naturally, sellers who is aware of the actual inventory position might use persuasion to encourage early purchases by signaling product availability or anticipated price changes. This application is vital in industries like airlines and hotels where pricing strategies can significantly influence demand. Drakopoulos and Iyer (2017) and Küçükgül et al. (2019) demonstrate how sellers can signal product availability to persuade buyers to purchase the product earlier (and potentially at a higher price), thus maximizing revenue over time. Social Networks: The spread of information through social networks can significantly impact user engagement and product adoption, especially when there\u0026rsquo;s network effect. Platforms may use information design to manipulate how content is perceived, enhancing engagement or directing product adoption behaviors. Candogan and Drakopoulos (2019) focus on social networks, exploring how platforms can design signaling mechanisms that reveal the accuracy of content, influencing users\u0026rsquo; decisions to engage with or share the content. Two-sided Markets: In platform-based industries like e-commerce or ride-sharing, information about the quality of service providers can affect consumer trust and transaction volumes. Information design can be used to manage the reputation of a platform by signaling seller or service quality. Papanastasiou et al. (2017) study how platforms can induce exploration by provisioning information appropriately to their users, potentially enhancing user experience and increasing platform value. assumptions to relax or improve upon Info design in operations highlights several challenges that arise when applying these theories to practical settings.\nDesign Complexity: Solving for optimal signals that effectively influence the diverse and sometimes conflicting actions of multiple agents with varying preferences poses significant complexity. Also, when the structure of the environment (e.g. social networks) is challenging in the first place, matters worse. Informational Spillovers: Designed signals may unintentionally affect unintended receivers due to spillovers, this complicates the targeted impact of the information design, therefore makes the design job complicated in the first place. Assumption of Common Prior Knowledge: The practicality of information design is often challenged by the unrealistic assumption that all agents share common and public prior knowledge, which may not hold in real settings. Integration with Operational Levers: Effectively combining information design with other operational strategies like pricing or inventory management requires a deep, nuanced understanding in modelling, as well as hard-to-do but necessary real-application to justify and complement the theory. For all the key assumptions imposed in information design that need not hold in various operational settings, some recent works attempt at discussing when such assumptions are violated. This presents an exciting avenue for future investigations and applications. For example, the complexities inherent in dynamic settings, where the conditions and participant behaviors can evolve over time, is seldomly addressed in conventional information design that assumes a one-shot game. So there is significant opportunities to explore how information strategies can be optimized and applied across various operational settings that lasts and changes over time.\nAnd another last point: in practice, some businesses and markets naturally apply principles of information design—such as rating platforms, Google Maps updating real-time traffic status, and recommendation systems. Informational advantages arise not only when the real state of the world is unknown but also when the cost of obtaining more concrete information is substantial. Generally, existing studies tend to oversimplify this by equating the latter scenario with the former. But, is this equivalence entirely accurate?\nin conclusion In the last decade, there has been substantial interest in information design. The existing literature has laid the foundation for systematically approaching information design problems. In addition, the applications of information design in many different settings have been explored.\nThere are some early work in the area, but it\u0026rsquo;s like the pandora\u0026rsquo;s box has just been opened.\nreference: Ozan Candogan (2020) Information Design in Operations INFORMS TutORials in Operations Research. doi: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3920-402XOzan\n","permalink":"/posts/info_design_om/","summary":"My advisor was somehow less enthusiastic in information design as compared to other general algorithm game theory topics–despite my several failed attempts to lure him into doing some related projects.

The recent Freakonomics podcast episode, \u0026ldquo;The Men Who Started a Thinking Revolution (Update),\u0026rdquo; features an interview with journalist Michael Lewis about his 2016 book The Undoing Project, which offers a high-level exploration of Kahneman\u0026rsquo;s impact on our understanding of ourselves.\nSome brilliant highlights from the podcast:\nMichael Lewis There aren’t many people in the world who write excellent books that also get turned into excellent films. Among them is this guy …\nMichael LEWIS: My name is Michael Lewis and I just think of myself as a writer.\nFor context, Moneyball (2011)—a six-time Academy Award nominee directed by Bennett Miller and starring Brad Pitt—was based on Lewis\u0026rsquo;s 2003 book of the same name. Adam McKay\u0026rsquo;s The Big Short (2015), which depicts Wall Street maneuvers during the 2007-2008 U.S. housing bubble, was also adapted from one of Lewis\u0026rsquo;s works. At first glance, Lewis’s books might not seem suited for Hollywood adaptations.\nLEWIS: I was astonished that anybody bothered to make Moneyball*, much less* The Big Short*. And so my experience with the movie business is peculiar because what seems to happen is I write books that are ever harder to turn into movies and they work ever harder to make them into movies.*\nHis latest challenge is The Undoing Project, which focuses on two academics—Israeli psychologists Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman—who spent decades together writing papers.\nAmos Tversky, and Daniel Kahneman Amos was asked once by somebody who says “Does the work you and Danny do have any bearing on artificial intelligence?”\nAnd Amos said: “I’m much more interested in natural stupidity than I am in artificial intelligence.”\nAlthough Amos Tversky passed away in 1996, before Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Prize and published the wildly popular Thinking, Fast and Slow in 2011, Tversky\u0026rsquo;s contributions are no less significant. The book offers a more personal view on Tversky and Kahneman, resembling a biography more than a semi-technical textbook.\nMichael Lewis’s The Undoing Project is a portrait of two men who redefined many of our assumptions about human thought and decision-making. Kahneman and Tversky met in the late 1960s at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Despite their differences—Tversky was outgoing and assertive, Kahneman introspective and riddled with insecurities—they looked at psychology from very different angles at the beginning. Tversky, being a mathematical psychologist, happily accepted the assumptions of economics and mathematical psychology—that people are basically rational and good intuitive statisticians when making decisions. Kahneman, on the other hand, being less mathematically inclined but highly intuitive, thought mainstream economics and psychology’s rationality assumptions were ludicrous and told Tversky as much.\nLEWIS: Kahneman thought that the standard assumptions of mainstream economics and psychology were ridiculous. And he said so, to Amos Tversky’s face, when Kahneman invited Tversky to speak to a graduate seminar that Kahneman was teaching. Tversky, with his usual brio, began to extol the notion that most people are pretty good at making decisions based on a rational assessment of the available information.\nDanny is the first one to really challenge him on this saying, “I’m not! I make mistake after mistake after mistake and I’m smarter than most of the people I know. This is nonsense, that I can show to you that people make systematic mistakes when they’re faced with decisions and judgments.” And this intrigued Amos. And very quickly they’re in a room together with a door shut and don’t want to see anybody else. And a collaboration begins. And the collaboration is all about the exploration of how the human mind actually works.\nSo the story begins. Btw, this collaboration was surprising to just about everyone at Hebrew University.\nLEWIS: They were regarded as two big dogs on campus yet they were also regarded as polar opposites. No one who knew them both could imagine them spending five minutes together. Kahneman was difficult, neurotic, seemingly perpetually unhappy, full of doubt, you know, tortured. He was very fertile, had lots of ideas, but the minute he had the ideas he thought they were crap and he would walk away from his own ideas very quickly. What he says now is he had a peculiar talent for changing his mind. He liked changing his mind. That’s a nice spin —\nDUBNER: Do you believe it?\nLEWIS: I think it’s much more complicated than that. I think that he doesn’t know what stability feels like. He was a child of the Holocaust. He spent ages 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 being chased through southern France by Nazis and hiding in chicken coops and barns. He watched his father die because he couldn’t seek medical treatment for fear of being caught by the Germans. And he himself has as one of his central qualities a kind of evasiveness. People found him hard to know. But incredibly talented.\nAside from their significant contributions to psychology, economics, and public welfare—including in the medical field—Kahneman and Tversky have profoundly impacted countless lives, whether individuals recognize it or not.\nLEWIS: It’s a messy story, but it is incredible to me how many different spheres of human existence these guys’ work has touched and influenced. So it’s not just economics. You know, medicine. It’s now a standard part of medical training for doctors to be introduced to Kahneman and Tversky’s work or at least their ideas, because they’re going to be rendering intuitive judgments about patients and they need to be aware of how they might be fallible. In government, I think the big influence that Amos and Danny have had is in an awareness of the importance of choice architecture — that the environment in which people make the decision has a huge effect on the decision. And if you want government workers to save more money, you design the pension plans so that they have to opt out of them rather than opt into them. And all of a sudden you double or triple the savings rates. If you want school lunches to be healthy, you create the default option as a healthy option and force to kids to trade it in for a less healthy option if they want it. There are units in the U.S. government, in the British government, in the Australian government, the German government’s interested in it, the Scandinavian governments. They’re calling them Nudge units, after Dick Thaler and Cass Sunstein’s work. But this job is really to create environments that will lead people to make choices that are good for them. And that really comes out of Danny and Amos’s work. One of their great discoveries is that people don’t make clean, clear decisions between things, or choices between things. They make choices between descriptions of things. And so how things are described have a huge effect on the way people choose, and governments are often charged with creating these decision-making environments.\nAmidst the backdrop of their groundbreaking work, it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable how fate serendipitously united these two distinct scholars, blending their complementary talents to unfurl a narrative that has profoundly shaped our understanding of human decision-making.\nDUBNER: So these two guys, Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky, had an incredibly fruitful, original intellectual partnership that was also a very rocky relationship. At times Danny felt that Amos was getting a lot of credit for their work. Danny could be resentful and insecure, and as you write the story, three days before Amos Tversky was diagnosed with melanoma they had effectively ended their friendship. Kahneman called it a “divorce.” Amos died. Danny later won a Nobel Prize in economics and Amos, being dead, was not eligible to receive that. So Danny wins the Nobel for work that had been done largely with Amos. So talk for a minute about Danny’s feelings about the award and all the recognition and opportunity it brought to him with his partner gone.\nLEWIS: One of the most lovable things about Danny Kahneman is as much as he tortures other people with his doubt, he tortures himself even more. And when Amos had died, he was left with a sense, Danny, that the world found their work extremely important, but maybe thought maybe he didn’t have much to do with it.\nPersonally, I\u0026rsquo;m finding that Daniel Kahneman has influenced me more than I had imagined. Before I was even aware of his name, I had read Thinking, Fast and Slow mindlessly in high school, simply picking one and the book from my dad\u0026rsquo;s shelf. Many of my friends idolize Kahneman, and being aware of his ideas and research results has completely shifted the way I view and plan my life. And the same seems to be true for Stephen DUBNER:\nDUBNER: And he deserves it, frankly, right?\nLEWIS: My God. I’ve written about a lot of people and I’ve got a lot of characters in my life over the course of my career. I’ve never had one of such depth of interest as Danny Kahneman. Everything that comes out of his mouth is interesting. Everything he thinks is interesting. He just doesn’t believe it.\n(Dubner) For the record, it was the work of Kahneman and Tversky that first got me interested in economics, and which led to Freakonomics. Before them, economics seemed too methodical; too bloodless. So I’m grateful to Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky for shining their light into the human brain—and I’m thankful to Michael Lewis for shining his light on them.\nDisclaimer: The content within the quotations in this blog post has been adapted from the Freakonomics podcast episode \u0026ldquo;The Men Who Started a Thinking Revolution (Update).\u0026rdquo; I do not claim originality for these excerpts, and all intellectual contributions belong to the original authors and the production team of the Freakonomics podcast.\n","permalink":"/posts/danny_kahnemann_podcast/","summary":"The first time I encountered the name \u0026ldquo;Daniel Kahneman\u0026rdquo; was in a behavioral economics class, where we were introduced to his seminal 1979 Econometrica paper on \u0026ldquo;prospect theory.\u0026rdquo; Initially, I pigeonholed him as an economist—a label he might not dispute, given his significant contributions to the interdisciplinary field of experimental economics, which bridges psychology and economics and has been instrumental in the development of behavioral economics.\nHowever, Daniel Kahneman is perhaps more a psychologist than an economist.","title":"mind games - how two psychologists rewrote the rules on human thought"},{"content":" And how many years can some people exist\nBefore they\u0026rsquo;re allowed to be free?\n– Bob Dylan, Blowing in the Wind\nIt is becoming easier for non-college graduates to settle for a job in metropolitans, thanks to the growing platform economy that lowers the bar for job entry. As netizen jokes for the go-to job choices, about the three so-called auspicious opportunities: security, cleaning, insurance sellers and the challenging ironman triathlon: takeout delivery, courier, uber driver\u0026quot;.\nToday, as digitization sweeps across the globe, the digital-intergrative industries, notably takeaway delivery, express delivery and uber drivers have rapidly become integral to China\u0026rsquo;s economic landscape. These sectors have not only transformed consumer habits and lifestyles but have also become crucial in the job market. Reports suggest that these industries act as stabilizers for employment in China, especially during economic fluctuations, by providing numerous job opportunities. However, this trend also prompts deeper reflection: Should a country\u0026rsquo;s employment depend heavily on these sectors? Does this reliance indicate an imbalance in economic development?\nA recent report An irrevocable courier complaint illustrated a problem of courier business. Simply speaking, the system design is driving delivery service workers crazy, meanwhile also making customers uncomfortable. Delivery companies designed a set of strict indicator assessment system that regulates couriers\u0026rsquo; work: signing rate (every time slot to be assessed), complaint rate, timely rate of solicitation, logistics stagnation\u0026hellip; any abnormality in data or violation result in large penalties. Even worse, the system design is far from benign, that it penalizes delivery workers harshly for any small complaint possible, and even induces mistakenly placed complaints by designing misleading user interfaces.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to compete against algorithms. And it\u0026rsquo;s becoming a common approach for platforms to design their system in an over-simplifying manner that somehow shifted the real operational pitfalls of the platform into uneasieness and conflicts between end workers and consumers.\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t sounds right. In general, the \u0026ldquo;ironman triathlon\u0026rdquo; jobs pay low and is extremely demanding. From the employee\u0026rsquo;s perspective, the work intensity in sectors such as takeaway and courier services is notably high, and labor protections are often insufficient. Many workers endure long hours, unstable incomes, and a lack of social security benefits. Additionally, the relatively low skill requirements associated with these industries do not support the long-term career development of the workforce.\nTake a higher view, over-reliance on specific industries, particularly low-end services such as takeaways and express delivery, can indicate an imbalance in economic development. This disparity is evident not only in the industrial framework but also in the labor market structure.\nPlatform economic flourishes, but maybe the platforms should be more aware of their social responsibilities. Now that they are somewhat too concentrated on (or perhaps, trapped in) the revenue objective. Digitalization and algorithmic optimization on one hand, boost efficiency and facilitate the industry, on the other hand, they trigger involution and suppressed the surplus space of the workers and consumers. Who is to blame for the growing discontent, hostility, collision of interest, and even tragedies observed on all these platforms?\nIn the end, it\u0026rsquo;s growing more like a bad equilibrium, trapping almost everyone inside a digital siege.\n","permalink":"/posts/blowing_in_the_wind/","summary":"And how many years can some people exist\nBefore they\u0026rsquo;re allowed to be free?\n– Bob Dylan, Blowing in the Wind\nIt is becoming easier for non-college graduates to settle for a job in metropolitans, thanks to the growing platform economy that lowers the bar for job entry.

My initial thought was that the problem belongs to market failures, that potential solutions lies in redesigning the selling mechanism and boost information transparency etc.. But here\u0026rsquo;s another way of tackling the problem, which is somehow pretty fancy:\nApple futures, as the name suggests, are futures varieties with apples as the underlying, which were listed on China\u0026rsquo;s Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange on December 22, 2017, and are the world\u0026rsquo;s first fresh fruit futures variety to be listed. The quality threshold is pretty high that only top-standard apples are taken into account.\nwhy can apples be futures? The market scale is large enough: China is the world\u0026rsquo;s largest producer and consumer of apples, there is a large-scale spot market that makes apples almost impossible for a few people to control and monopolize.\nApple\u0026rsquo;s quality assessment is easy. The grading standard for apples has a clear definition of the standard, fruit shape, color, freshness, fruit stalks, fruit rust, fruit surface defects and other aspects. Existing technology such as photoelectric grading machine, can determine the grade according to the fruit color and weight and so on automatically.\nPrice fluctuations are large and frequent:\nDuring the apple harvest period, a large number of new year apples flow into the spot market, market supply increases, and wholesale prices are relatively low. Then from December to February, affected by the New Year\u0026rsquo;s Day and the Chinese New Year festivities, market demand increases, and wholesale prices gradually rise. in March and April, apples from the mechanical cold storage are concentrated in the warehouse, and the supply becomes larger, driving prices down. In May, with the end of the shipments from the mechanical cold storage, the supply decreases, and prices rebound. from June to April, apples from the mechanical cold storage are concentrated in the warehouse, and the supply decreases, and prices rebound. Between June and August, early and mid-ripening apples were concentrated in the market, and prices were relatively low, leading to an overall decrease in wholesale apple prices. Weather factors, light and temperature are the two factors that have the greatest impact on apple production. Bad weather, such as frost, drought and other conditions will seriously affect the yield and quality of apples\nwhy making apples futures? \u0026ldquo;poverty alleviation fruits\u0026rdquo;:\nDomestic apple production is concentrated in low-income areas. The Ministry of Agriculture identified 122 key apple counties and cities, of which 39 are national poverty-stricken counties, where apple cultivation is the main source of income for tens of millions of local farmer.\nFarmers scattered planting for the ability to withstand natural disasters and market risk is low, \u0026ldquo;big year and small year\u0026rdquo; brought about by price fluctuations will be almost unbearable for them. So \u0026ldquo;fruit\u0026rdquo; futures to establish the initial major purpose is to alleviate the risk of price fluctuations, to protect the rights and interests of fruit farmers. After the listing of apple futures, through the provision of open and transparent prices, timely and effective reflection of changes in the spot market, can provide market price reference for the industry to provide the basis for decision-making. Similar to the same \u0026ldquo;fruit\u0026rdquo; futures one of the jujube, is to promote the Xinjiang farmers income \u0026ldquo;fruit\u0026rdquo;, and cotton to bring the \u0026ldquo;white economy\u0026rdquo; has a similar effect.\nThis new product model sought to improve the agricultural support and protection system, as well as the rural financial services system. The business model of \u0026ldquo;insurance + futures\u0026rdquo; is an innovative pilot financial product to support agricultural and rural development. Agricultural futures prices are used as the basis for insurance underwriting and claims. Insured households pay premiums to purchase insurance products, insurance companies purchase over-the-counter options from futures companies to hedge part of the payout risk, and futures companies carry out replica option operations in the futures market to further diversify risks. Upon expiration of the options, the futures company will make payment and settlement to the insurance company, and the insurance company will then pay out to the insured households. The \u0026ldquo;insurance + futures\u0026rdquo; model combines the risk avoidance function of the futures market with the insurance industry\u0026rsquo;s role in underwriting claims.\n","permalink":"/posts/apple_futures/","summary":"Previously, we discussed the challenges faced by apple farmers in ShaanXi, China (see the sweet and sour of apples and cranberries), that the farmers battle against the fluctuating price by strategically storing apple inventories so as to sell later, yet their decisions are far from optimal that brings regret and misfortune that sabotages the families\u0026rsquo; living business.

At time $t$, a decision maker chooses an \u0026lsquo;action\u0026rsquo; or arm $i_t\\in \\mathcal I$ ($\\mathcal I$ is the known set of distributions). The chosen machine returns a random reward $r_t$ following its distribution $Q_t$. Our goal as the octopus is to maximize the expected cumulative rewards $\\sum_{t = 1}^T \\mathbb E[r_t]$.\nThe challenge arises because $Q_t$ is unknown. Based on assumptions about the structure of the distributions and given the total period length $T$, the goal is to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off. First, we learn $Q_t$, then optimize the policy that follows to minimize regret: $$ \\mathcal R_T = \\sum_{t = 1}^T R^{\\pi^}t - \\sum{t = 1}^T R^\\pi_t $$ where $R^{\\pi^}$ is the optimal policy of the oracle, knowing all distributions in advance.\nThere are several variations of the bandit problem:\nStochastic Stationary Bandits: Here, the distributions $Q_t$ are i.i.d. over time and independent of the rewards from playing the other arms. This setting is generally considered the most straightforward. Adversarial Bandits: Each arm is initially assigned an arbitrary and unknown sequence of rewards. This variant is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of the rewards. Nonstationary Bandits: The rewards are stochastic but change over time, presenting a balance in difficulty between the stochastic and adversarial models. Vanilla: Stochastic Bandit The basic setting of multi-armed bandits (MAB) provides initial insights into the algorithms and objectives of study. Formally:\nEnvironment: $$ \\epsilon = {\\nu: (P_a: a\\in \\mathcal A): P_a \\in \\mathcal M_a , \\forall a\\in \\mathcal A} $$ A specific instance $\\nu$ is defined by $K$ arms with reward distributions represented as $\\nu := [P_1, \u0026hellip;, P_K]$.\nIn each period $t = 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, T$, an arm $A_t\\in [K]$ is pulled and a reward $X_t \\sim P_{A_t}$ is collected.\nHistorical actions and rewards are recorded as: $$ H_{t - 1} = (A_1, X_1, \u0026hellip;, A_{t - 1}, X_{t - 1}) $$\nA policy maps the history to the current arm to be pulled: $$ \\pi_t: H_{t-1} \\to [K] $$\nGiven an instance, the policy executes at each period to choose an arm. The algorithm\u0026rsquo;s goal is to maximize cumulative rewards, while performance is evaluated as regret against an oracle: $$ R_n(\\pi, \\nu) = n\\mu^*(\\nu) - E[\\sum_{t =1}^T X_t] $$ Note that the player knows the environment (the class of reward distributions) but not the actual instance (the specific distributions). Ultimately, our algorithm attempts to optimize for $\\min_\\pi \\max_{\\nu \\in \\epsilon} R_n(\\nu, \\pi)$.\nTypically, we study environments that satisfy the sub-gaussian assumption: $\\epsilon = {P_1, \u0026hellip;, P_K, P_i \\sim 1-\\text{subgaussian}}$. This means each $P_i$ has tail behavior that is tightly bounded.\nThe explore-then-commit algorithm uses the early period to explore arms and the rest committing to a learnt best option.

Hu et al., MSOM 2015\nABSTRACT We study an organization’s one-time capacity investment in a renewable energy-producing technology with supply intermittency and net metering compensation. The renewable technology can be coupled with conventional technologies to form a capacity portfolio that is used to meet stochastic demand for energy. The technologies have different initial investments and operating costs, and the operating costs follow different stochastic processes. We show how to reduce this problem to a single-period decision problem and how to estimate the joint distribution of the stochastic factors using historical data. Importantly, we show that data granularity for renewable yield and electricity demand at a fine level, such as hourly, matters: Without energy storage, coarse data that does not reflect the intermittency of renewable generation may lead to an overinvestment in renewable capacity. We obtain solutions that are simple to compute, intuitive, and provide managers with a framework for evaluating the trade-offs of investing in renewable and conventional technologies. We illustrate our model using two case studies: one for investing in a solar rooftop system for a bank branch and another for investing in a solar thermal system for water heating in a hotel, along with a conventional natural gas heating system.\nMotivation: Nowadays, firms, as general consumers of electricity, are increasingly willing to invest in installing renewable energy-generating technologies, such as solar and wind power, to fulfill a portion of their energy needs. Incentives include (i) genuine goodwill or environmental responsibility, or pressures from government or public opinion that lead firms to take \u0026lsquo;sustainability\u0026rsquo; more seriously (ii) installing self-supplying energy-generating facilities to offset the risk of volatile electricity prices and save money in some way (iii) monetary incentives, such as government-sponsored \u0026rsquo;net energy metering (NEM) programs,\u0026rsquo; which buy back surplus electricity at a discounted price. This paper explores the optimal methods for investing in these technologies.\nModel: Consider the simplest setting where the firm plans a one-time investment $k$ in renewable energy facilities, i.e., $k$ solar panels, so as to serve stochastic energy demand $X_t$ over $t = 1, \u0026hellip;, T$ periods. The total investment cost per facility, $v$, includes insurance and maintenance, amounting to $vk$ for $k$ facilities.\nThe effective capacity of the facilities in any period is variable, accounting for supply intermittency: denote the yield rate in period $t$ by $\\Lambda_t\\in [0, 1]$, so the effective electricity generated in period $t$ is $\\Lambda_t k$. Let $w$ be the unit operating cost (which is usually taken as negative sometimes to reflect the government\u0026rsquo;s tax credit for generating renewable energy). NEM compensation (i.e., government buyback of extra produced energy) is credited at a rate of $M_t$ per unit (say, kWh). If there is unmet demand in any period, the firm can source energy from the spot market at a random cost $P_t$.\nDenote $\\mathbf Y_t = {X_t, \\Lambda_t, M_t, P_t}$ as the vector of stochastic processes, total operating cost to meet demand at period $t$ is $$ C(k; \\mathbf Y_t) = \\underbrace{w\\Lambda_t k}{\\text{generated power}} + \\underbrace{P_t(X_t - \\Lambda_t k)^+}{\\text{purchased power}} - \\underbrace{M_t(\\Lambda_t k - X_t)^+}{\\text{sold surplus power}} $$ The firm\u0026rsquo;s cost-minimization problem is then $$ \\min{k} \\mathcal C(k) = \\sum_{t = 1}^T \\delta^{t-1}\\mathbb E_{Y_t} [C(k; \\mathbf Y_t)] + vk $$\nConversion to a Single-Period Problem: By setting $T = 1$, we reduce the optimization to a variant of the standard newsvendor model. For general $T$​, we convert the problem to a single-period model due to the cost structure\u0026rsquo;s linearity and the fixed nature of the investment decision across all periods. Adios to Dynamic Programming. The idea is, normalize by $\\Delta_T = \\sum_{t = 1}^T \\delta^{t -1}$ and treat every time-discounting factor $\\delta^{t - 1}$ as the distribution weights over $\\mathbf Y_t$, yielding another distribution $\\mathcal Y$, and the cost equals to\n$$ \\mathcal C(k) = \\mathbb E_{\\mathcal Y} [C(k; \\mathcal Y)] + \\frac v{\\Delta_T} k $$ Subsequently, the problem can be addressed using a variation of the newsvendor model.\nApplication and Insights: One of the paper\u0026rsquo;s key contributions is its application – estimating and testing on real data. Apart from this, an insight:\ninsights granularity matters\nDuring modelling we just assumes time unit $t = 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, T$. In practice, it matters whether these units corresponds to 15 minutes or a day. The paper demonstrated that, fine-grained time slices (\u0026lt;=4h) ensures accurate estimation, whereas if time units are taken to be too large, the model tends to invest more facilities than optimal. Which make sense, because larger granularity almost corresponds to storing surplus self-generated electricity to use later. If such flexibility is allowed, the model indeed should prefer investing in more facilities.\n","permalink":"/posts/electrically_economic/","summary":"Our Frontiers of Management Science Seminar looked into a study that grounded operational management analysis in real application:\nCapacity Investment in Renewable Energy Technology with Supply Intermittency: Data Granularity Matters!

On Matching and Thickness in Heterogeneous Dynamic Markets (OR2019).\nkidney exchange 101 Before diving into the paper, here\u0026rsquo;s how kidney exchange actually works.\nthe concept of \u0026ldquo;exchange\u0026rdquo; Kidney transplantation is essential for patients with late-stage renal failure. While a healthy individual can donate one of their kidneys to their loved ones, often the donor is incompatible with the intended recipient. Kidney exchange allows such patient–donor pairs to swap donors so that each patient can receive a kidney from a compatible donor.\nThere are two main methods of conducting kidney exchanges: swaps (bilateral matching) and chains.\nSwaps (Bilateral Matching): Consider incompatible pairs $(P_1, D_1)$ and $(P_2, D_2)$, where $P_i$ represents a patient and $D_i$ their intended donor. If $D_1 \\not\\to P_1$ and $D_2 \\not \\to P_2$, but $D_2 \\to P_1$ and $D_1 \\to P_2$, a two-way cycle can be formed for simultaneous transplants. Due to logistical constraints, only bilateral matching is commonly practiced, requiring adjacent operating rooms for donors and recipients.\nChains: In scenarios with unpaired donors, such as altruistic \u0026ldquo;angel\u0026rdquo; donors or deceased donors, chains can be initiated in the donation pool. For example, an initial donor $D_0$ donates to patient $P_1$, whose donor $D_1$ then donates to $P_2$, and so on. Contrary to concerns about donors defaulting once their loved ones receive a kidney, chains often continue due to a pay-it-forward mentality. The longest chain on record involves over 130 transplants. Chains offer logistical advantages, as surgeries can be performed sequentially, unlike the simultaneous requirement of swaps.\ncompatibility In mechanism design (and general CS-Econ), patient-donor pairs are often simply classified as compatible or incompatible. While this abstraction is useful for theoretical analysis, the reality of kidney compatibility is more complex. Understanding this complexity can inform our work and help us appreciate the level of abstraction in existing research.\nThe key to compatibility lies in the interaction between antibodies and antigens. Antibodies – those Y-shaped proteins in our blood – identify and initiate immune attack foreign antigens on invaders like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody usually only identify their specific corresponding antigens.\nIn the context of transplantation, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and their corresponding antibodies are especially relevant for compatibility. If the donor kidney\u0026rsquo;s HLA (antigens!) reacts with certain antibody contained in the blood of the recipients, the kidney is likely to be attacked by immune system and transplant fails.\ntissue typing:\nOut of over 100 different HLA antigens that have been identified, there are six that have been shown to be the most important in organ transplantation. This process involves determining the HLA types of both donor and recipient. It is crucial for assessing compatibility and is closely related to the evaluation of PRA.\npercent reactive antibody (PRA)\nPRA is a metric evaluated for the recipient that measure how many HLA antibodies he/she has in her blood. A higher PRA suggests a higher likelihood of incompatibility with potential donors in general population, making it more challenging to find a matching kidney.\nPRA provides an estimate of the percentage of donors with whom a recipient would be incompatible, reflecting the expected wait time for a transplant.\nserum crossmatch: positive/negative\nA serum crossmatch is a blood test the recipient and the donor will have multiple times, including right before the transplant surgery. Blood from certain donor and recipient are mixed. If the recipient\u0026rsquo;s cells attack and kill the donor cells, the crossmatch is considered positive. If the crossmatch is negative, the pair is considered compatible and surgeries may then be carried out.\nmatching market There have been efforts to create and coordinate large platforms to increase opportunities for kidney exchanges. Numerous kidney exchange platforms operate in the United States and in other countries, varying in size (thickness), composition (PRA composition), and policies. For size of the market, one would generally consider how large the pool of paired donor-recipient is (in terms of absolute quantities). For composition, it would be the arrival rate of different PRA-patients. Policies would involves whether chain or swap is used, and how different patients with varying PRA value would be prioritized.\npaper Motivated from real world policy choice of design of kidney matching policies, the paper took a rather stylized modelling approach and asymptotic approach, but does capture some important features of kidney exchange – to characterize the heterogeneity of patient\u0026rsquo;s PRA level, to shed insight on how market thickness and prioritizing policy would affect wait time.\nmodel The paper study matching policies in two different settings–agents might exchange items (1) bilaterally in a cyclic fashion or (2) through chains. We\u0026rsquo;ll establish the model in basic \u0026ldquo;swap\u0026rdquo; scenario and then extend to chain.\nswap Consider an infinite-horizon dynamic matching market, where each arriving agent is endowed with a single item she wants to exchange for another item she finds compatible. Agents are indifferent between compatible items and wish to exchange as soon as possible.\nThere are two types of agents, H (hard-to-match) and E (easy). Beginning at $t = 0$, type $T\\in {H, E}$ agents arrive to the market according to an independent Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_H[\\lambda_E]$. Any agent of type $H[E]$ would find the item of any other agents compatible with probability $p_H[p_E]$. The analysis is asymptotic in the sense that $p_H \\to 0, p_E \\text{ constant}$ which corresponds to the case that kidney recipients are almost bimodal distributed - they are either very easy to match (PRA \u0026lt; 5%) or hardly matchable (PRA \u0026gt; 95%). If both agents find each other\u0026rsquo;s item desirable, they can be matched. Matched agents leaves the market.\nchain Chains are initiated by \u0026ldquo;angel\u0026rdquo; donor. Assume at $t = 0$ there are $d$ special altruistic agents who are willing to give an item without getting anything in return. Each agent in a chain receives a compatible item from one agent and gives to the next. Following on, at any time $t$, there are exactly $d$ such bridge agents.\nThe state of the marketplace can be characterized as a compatibility graph. A policy is a mapping from the history of exchanges and the state of the marketplace to a set of feasible exchanges involving nonoverlapping sets of agents–compatible pairs or chains–break ties to exchange and agents leave.\nThe objective the paper studied is the average waiting time in steady state. Note, in the model, the average waiting time of one type of agents is equivalent to the average number of agents of that type in the marketplace divided by the arrival rate of that type, because these two quantities are proportional to each other by Little’s law.\nThis research looked at two myopic policies (used in practise):\nBilateral match wrt $T$: upon arrival of a new agent, if cycle of length 2 is formed, those agents are immediately matched. If more than one such cycle exists, priority is assigned to cycles of with type $T$, further ties are broken uniformly at random. Chain match (d): for new arriving agent, build bridge (disjoint path) from it until bridge can no longer be extended. Prioritize $H$ agents, further ties are broken uniformly at random. results The paper studies the influence of how (1) market composition (such as how extensive is $H$ agents) and (2) thickness (Poisson arrival rates of the two types) would affect the bilateral-match/chain market, respectively. The asymptotic approach they took simplified the analysis a lot–using a lot of clever tricks. Still, the maths are quite hard-core and I haven\u0026rsquo;t read through them yet.\nSome theoretical and numerical results shed insights on real world matching policy choice: matching through chains is significantly more efficient than (simple) bilateral matching only when the market is sufficiently thin. Furthermore, counter-intuitively, increasing the arrival rate of hard-to-match agents may have, under bilateral matching, an adverse effect on such agents.\n","permalink":"/posts/optimizing_kidney_exchanges/","summary":"Looking at two-sided market literatures so as to motivate one of my recently launched project, here\u0026rsquo;s a brief reading write-up of two papers.\nStarting with the first one: Ashlagi et al.

Building on yesterday\u0026rsquo;s discussion, my visit to TaiLong Bank unveiled an innovative practice that has proven effective—engaging employees\u0026rsquo; parents.\nTaiLong Bank operates with a decentralized structure, empowering branches and sub-branches with significant autonomy. Notably, over 80% of loan decisions are made at the sub-branch level.\nWikipeadia, TaiLong Bank\nTaiLong Bank\u0026rsquo;s business model and employee distribution underscore the importance of this strategy. Serving SMEs (small-and-micro-enterprises) demands meticulous investigation, unlike the broad strokes of big-data-driven models. This approach results in a workforce of over 10,000, with more than half being managers embedded in communities to nurture business relationships.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fair to say that TaiLong\u0026rsquo;s success hinges on the expertise and commitment of its employees. Therefore, retaining and motivating them is crucial. Beyond standard benefits like snacks and insurance, TaiLong has implemented unique initiatives to engage employees\u0026rsquo; parents:\nEmployees can participate in an A-B deposit scheme, where a monthly deposit of ¥100 in the A account yields ¥300 for their parents in the B account. Employees receive a special holiday when their parents visit Shanghai, allowing them to spend quality time together in the city. These initiatives may seem modest in monetary terms, especially compared to hedge funds offering substantial stock options. However, they resonate deeply with the staff. During my visit to TaiLong Bank\u0026rsquo;s Shanghai headquarters, I encountered numerous employees who spoke proudly of these measures, describing them as \u0026ldquo;emotionally comforting\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;parent-friendly.\u0026rdquo; This approach has significantly enhanced their families\u0026rsquo; pride and recognition of their work.\nThis concept aligns with psychological theories suggesting that people manage multiple mental accounts, not just a single utility function. Employees likely perceive these parental benefits as a separate account from their salaries, imbuing them with additional psychological value. After all, securing your parents\u0026rsquo; pride in your work is an achievement that\u0026rsquo;s worth its weight in gold—perhaps even more elusive than a salary hike, but undeniably priceless.\n","permalink":"/posts/cloying_your_employees/","summary":"Another day, another mountain of literature on boosting employee productivity and fostering workplace belonging.

However, Zhejiang Tailong Commercial Bank (TaiLong Bank) takes the less-traveled path – the bank provides financial services to small-and-micro-enterprises (SMEs). Since its inception, the bank has cumulatively provided over ¥150 billion (around $23 billion) in loans, with an average loan size of ¥500,000, to its clientele, over 90% of whom are peasants-turned-entrepreneurs.\nThe bank originates in Taizhou, Zhejiang, an area that cradles family-owned workhouses which often develop into medium or even large-size production companies. The general people in Zhejiang province are known for their acumen and flexibility, hence often being termed as the \u0026ldquo;Oriental Jews.\u0026rdquo; The collective wisdom of the local people, as well as the natural nourishment of its business culture, give birth to the so-called \u0026lsquo;Taizhou\u0026rsquo; model – the core strategy that empowers TaiLong Bank to operate smaller-sized loan businesses.\nThere are three main challenges of SME financing:\nInformational Asymmetry: For small businesses, their accounting is often messy, thus standardized financial records that bear strong supportive power are often absent.\nSpeed: For example, a family-owned steamed bread house might receive an instant gigantic order and need to loan more money to purchase the corresponding ingredients that would otherwise be budget-infeasible for them. Small business\u0026rsquo;s financing calls are often swift, smaller, and more urgent.\nLack of Collateral: SMEs often don\u0026rsquo;t have adequate collateral that meets the standards set by common state-owned banks.\nThese challenges summarize why it is hard for both the businesses and the banks to borrow/lend money to one another. Rooting its ideology in the natural motivation of credit, TaiLong Bank took a customer-centralized community approach to overcome informational asymmetry and navigate risk. This approach involves:\nInvestigating three \u0026ldquo;meterings\u0026rdquo; and three \u0026ldquo;qualities\u0026rdquo;: The three meterings refer to water/electricity metering and export taxation reports. The qualities involve the persona, product, and assets. These seemingly extraneous pieces of information significantly reduce the credibility uncertainty of the clients. Cross-verification methods (aka having two risk managers evaluate at the same time) and multi-faceted information sources (aka gossip and comments from neighbors). Targeted loan decision-making: Based on previously acquired information, if the client is not \u0026ldquo;red-flagged\u0026rdquo; (i.e., does not have serious signals that disadvantage loan failure, such as severe alcoholism), loan permission is granted. The financing upper bound and interest rates are then decided case-dependently. Finally, the loan structure and guarantees are also determined based on preceding scrutiny. The high-density geographical nature of business in Zhejiang province plays a crucial role in the implementability of TaiLong Bank\u0026rsquo;s community-based loan approach. Those close-knit communities and the prevalence of family-owned businesses create a unique environment where information flows freely, and reputations are well-known locally. The bank\u0026rsquo;s ability to tap into this rich vein of community-based information allows it to make informed decisions with assess to creditworthiness.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fascinating. In a market where state-owned commercial banks dominate the larger client segment and cutting-edge tech companies use data-oriented tools to target smaller consumers, TaiLong Bank has carved out a niche for itself by focusing on the unique needs of SMEs. Their success is a testament to the power of understanding and going back to how things actually works, meanwhile respecting and navigating the most charming pandora box – risk. It\u0026rsquo;s inspiring to see how a seemingly basic, mundane method can thrive in a highly competitive environment, proving that sometimes, a humanity touch can make all the difference.\n","permalink":"/posts/lending_money_to_small_business/","summary":"In choosing between issuing a 1-billion loan to one massive state-owned enterprise or lending 1 million to a thousand smaller companies, most would prefer the first option as it seems more convenient and reliable.

Hosted by Steven D. Levitt, this episode\u0026rsquo;s guest Charles Duhigg shared his new book The Power of Habit.\nThe right conversation and the right moment can change everything.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s points that I\u0026rsquo;d find insightful from the podcast.\nthree baskets of conversations Not all conversations are created equal. We’re actually participating in one of three conversations: practical (What’s this really about?), emotional (How do we feel?), and social (Who are we?). Too often, when someone shares their feelings, our instinct might be to jump into problem-solving mode. This happens especially if we\u0026rsquo;re in a higher position of power.\n[LEVITT]: So one of the most basic insights in the book — and it sounds totally obvious once you present it, but it’s something that I personally was completely oblivious to for the first 40 plus years of my life — is that the person you’re talking to can have various different goals from a conversation. You just alluded to it. You were talking to your wife and you wanted empathy. But for most of my life, I thought that the purpose of every meaningful conversation was to find a solution to a problem. But I was so wrong. I learned along the way, and I was reinforced by your book, that there are all sorts of things people want out of conversations, and one of the most fundamental aspects of being able to talk to people is recognizing that and figuring out what the point is of any given conversation.\nBtw, empathy, especially from someone in authority, can be incredibly soothing.\nThe response for emotional conversation is hugely different from a problem solving one. In the former case, responding with empathy intentionally, or at least \u0026ldquo;pretending\u0026rdquo; to listen more and judge less can be fruitful in providing emotional support to others. It\u0026rsquo;s not about being insincere at all, and people won\u0026rsquo;t find it phoney.\nask deep questions Deep questions are the ones that prompt introspection and self-reflection. Asking someone how they see themselves or how they think the world sees them can lead to intimate revelations. It\u0026rsquo;s about creating a scenario where people feel safe enough to open up.\n[LEVITT]: Okay, so I have a permission giving example. I was at a conference with a set of incredibly high achieving people (\u0026hellip;) Before dinner, one of the organizers pulls me aside and asks me if I could be responsible for facilitating the dinner conversation at my table. (\u0026hellip;)\nAnd when the eight of us sat down at the table, I didn’t want people to make their standard introduction. I wanted each of us to tell our life story with one simple rule: that you couldn’t show any modesty. And I even used the word permission. I said,\n\u0026ldquo;I’m not only giving you permission to brag about how amazing you are. I’m insisting that you do it. I want you to tell your story in a way that breaks every social norm about restraint, about saying all the good things happened to you were because of luck. I want to hear the unfiltered version of your greatest hits.\u0026rdquo;\ntricks Reciprocity: when you share something personal, it often leads the other person to do the same.\nIn general, reciprocity is a powerful social norm that governs human interactions. When one person shares something personal or intimate, it often creates a sense of obligation or willingness in the other person to share something of similar depth.\nThe looping technique: listening to what the other person is saying and then paraphrasing or summarizing their message back to them.\nPositions: the moves would be slightly different depending on one\u0026rsquo;s relevant positions. For the empowered side, simply leading the intimacy of connection by initiating reciprocity, or giving permission of depth of talk would suffice. But for the other side, they might need to break the balance by stepping on the boundary–say, asking deep questions that touch the interest of the powered opposite to open up the conversation.\nHabit loop:\nEvery habit has three components. There’s a cue, which is a trigger for an automatic behavior.\nGood conversations are almost the same – they begin with a similar pattern – identify the cue and catch the opportunity is vital. Observe to actually see the person you\u0026rsquo;re speaking with, ask relevant and appropriate deep questions, listen, emphasize and reciprocate emotional connection in return:\nonce you know how to diagnose the cues and the rewards in your life (or, in our case, what makes a good conversation), then you can start shaping these new behaviors that become more and more automatic.\nIn conclusion, great conversations are an art form that requires empathy, openness, and a bit of strategic thinking. We\u0026rsquo;re borned and trained over our lives that it\u0026rsquo;s almost a natural instinct. But a bit more systematic strategy goes a long way, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n","permalink":"/posts/how_to_have_great_conversations/","summary":"The \u0026ldquo;People I Mostly Admire\u0026rdquo; podcast\u0026rsquo;s recent episode \u0026ldquo;How to Have Great Conversations\u0026rdquo; is immensely inspiring, informative, wise and useful.

After her death, she is summoned from her grave into the vengeful, deadly sisterhood of the Wilis, the ghosts of unmarried women who died after being betrayed by their lovers and take revenge in the night by dancing men to death by exhaustion (a popular theme in Romantic-era ballets). Led by Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, they target Albrecht when he comes to mourn at Giselle\u0026rsquo;s grave, but her great love frees him from their grasp. They gain their power in numbers as they effortlessly move through dramatic patterns and synchronized movements and control the stage with their long tulle dresses and stoic expressions, creating an ethereal atmosphere that builds as they gradually close in on Albrecht. By saving him from the Wilis, Giselle also saves herself from becoming one of them.\nWikipedia, Giselle\nHowever, Giselle is, after all, not the most techically demanding ballet. Its beauty roots in its expressiveness of the lead ballerina as well as its classical narrative that leaves space for intepretation. The intricate artistry of the ballerina is reflected in the dual-role acting challenge:\nWhen we meet Giselle in Act I, she is euphoric in love. When she reenters in Act II, a chill runs down our spine. This is a young girl who spirals from joie de vivre to darkness in the blink of an eye. The shift in movement quality is exquisite, from buoyant leaps to an ethereal weightlessness.\n6 Ways Giselle Will Give You the Wilis\nWell, to be honest, Don Quixote would have a more lively act I rendering rural life with its charming Kitri. Or if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for ballerina\u0026rsquo;s rendition of innocently sweet young girls, go for Coppélia. Giselle\u0026rsquo;s act I is expressive in its closing yet somewhat dull, especially when compared to its phenomenally fantastic second action.\nWatch here for Natalia Osipova\u0026rsquo;s version of Act II on YouTube. It\u0026rsquo;ll give you goosebumps. When the Willies floating onto the stage, I heard gasp in the audience out of awe.\nthe second act\u0026rsquo;s ghost scene is breathtakingly beautiful\nBallet en Blanc: First seen in La Sylphide (1832), this term refers to scenes that feature the female corps de ballet costumed in pure white, dancing completely unified choreography. Sometimes referred to as “pure ballet,” it emphasizes the larger patterns and dramatic power of the corps, which assumes a menacing aura in Giselle. Act II finds Ballet en Blanc taking the ghostly character of the Wilis who (wearing their wedding dresses and veils), with their signature “flattened” arabesques, move into frightening formations. The Wilis did ballet blanc before the swans in Swan Lake and the shades in La Bayadère.\nAlthough Giselle sacrificed herself to save her lover, few would condemn her to be an idiot falling in love–instead, the awe and respect awoken among the audience, for Giselle\u0026rsquo;s devotion is what makes the story powerful. It\u0026rsquo;s almost similar to little mermaid–dance on en pointe, or floating in the sea of blue, dimmed stage lightening of the second act.\n","permalink":"/posts/giselle1/","summary":"Giselle is about ephoric, despaired, yet innocently beautiful love.\nthe audience were very supportive and applauded until the very end–it was almost like that they\u0026rsquo;re hoping for an encore.\nAbout the story:\nThe ghost-filled ballet tells the tragic, romantic story of a beautiful young peasant girl named Giselle and a disguised nobleman named Albrecht, who fall in love, but when his true identity is revealed by his rival, Hilarion, Giselle goes mad and dies of heartbreak.","title":"Giselle"},{"content":"Teatri alla Scala Ballet Company 2024 performed Giselle in Shanghai Grand Theatre–for four consecutive nights, from Mar. 22th to 25th.

Brandon Chase. Mar. 21 2024. See here for the original report.\nToday, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) announced the world’s first successful transplant of a genetically-edited pig (porcine) kidney into a 62-year-old man living with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Surgeons from the Mass General Transplant Center conducted the four-hour-long surgery on Saturday, March 16. The procedure marks a major milestone in the quest to provide more readily available organs to patients.\nThe four-hour-long surgery was conduced on Saturday, March 16. The kidney, comes from a pig donor:\nThe pig kidney was provided by eGenesis of Cambridge, Mass., from a pig donor that was genetically-edited using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes to improve its compatibility with humans. Additionally, scientists inactivated porcine endogenous retroviruses in the pig donor to eliminate any risk of infection in humans. Over the past five years, MGH and eGenesis have conducted extensive collaborative research, with the findings published in Nature in 2023.\nMeanwhile, the patient is receiving his second kidney transplant already:\nMr. Slayman, who has been living with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension for many years, previously received a kidney transplant from a human deceased donor in December 2018, performed at MGH by Kawai, after being on dialysis seven years prior. The transplanted kidney showed signs of failure approximately five years later and Mr. Slayman resumed dialysis in May 2023. Since resuming dialysis, he encountered recurrent dialysis vascular access complications requiring visits to the hospital every two weeks for de-clotting and surgical revisions, significantly impacting his quality of life and a common problem among dialysis patients.\nI am genuinely happy and even, shocked for this fast progress. At the end of the report, quote Leonardo Riellathe, the Medical Director for Kidney Transplantation:\nSeventy years after the first kidney transplant and six decades following the advent of immunosuppressive medications, we stand on the brink of a monumental breakthrough in transplantation. At MGH alone, there are over 1,400 patients on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. Some of these patients will unfortunately die or get too sick to be transplanted due to the long waiting time on dialysis. I am firmly convinced that xenotransplantation represents a promising solution to the organ shortage crisis.\nAnd new field for interdisciplinary research that dives deep, does good, save lives.\n","permalink":"/posts/big_news/","summary":"History in the making:\nWorld’s First Genetically-Edited Pig Kidney Transplant into Living Recipient Performed at Massachusetts General Hospital PRESS RELEASE of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

Today, let\u0026rsquo;s stike the TERMINOLOGY:\nKidney exchange 101 the concept of \u0026ldquo;exchange\u0026rdquo; Kidney transplantation is essential for patients with late-stage renal failure. While a healthy individual can donate one of their kidneys to their loved ones, often the donor is incompatible with the intended recipient. Kidney exchange allows such patient–donor pairs to swap donors so that each patient can receive a kidney from a compatible donor.\nThere are two main methods of conducting kidney exchanges: swaps (bilateral matching) and chains.\nSwaps (Bilateral Matching): Consider incompatible pairs $(P_1, D_1)$ and $(P_2, D_2)$, where $P_i$ represents a patient and $D_i$ their intended donor. If $D_1 \\not\\to P_1$ and $D_2 \\not \\to P_2$, but $D_2 \\to P_1$ and $D_1 \\to P_2$, a two-way cycle can be formed for simultaneous transplants. Due to logistical constraints, only bilateral matching is commonly practiced, requiring adjacent operating rooms for donors and recipients.\nChains: In scenarios with unpaired donors, such as altruistic \u0026ldquo;angel\u0026rdquo; donors or deceased donors, chains can be initiated in the donation pool. For example, an initial donor $D_0$ donates to patient $P_1$, whose donor $D_1$ then donates to $P_2$, and so on. Contrary to concerns about donors defaulting once their loved ones receive a kidney, chains often continue due to a pay-it-forward mentality. The longest chain on record involves over 130 transplants. Chains offer logistical advantages, as surgeries can be performed sequentially, unlike the simultaneous requirement of swaps.\ncompatibility In mechanism design (and general CS-Econ), patient-donor pairs are often simply classified as compatible or incompatible. While this abstraction is useful for theoretical analysis, the reality of kidney compatibility is more complex. Understanding this complexity can inform our work and help us appreciate the level of abstraction in existing research.\nThe key to compatibility lies in the interaction between antibodies and antigens. Antibodies – those Y-shaped proteins in our blood – identify and initiate immune attack foreign antigens on invaders like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody usually only identify their specific corresponding antigens.\nIn the context of transplantation, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and their corresponding antibodies are especially relevant for compatibility. If the donor kidney\u0026rsquo;s HLA (antigens!) reacts with certain antibody contained in the blood of the recipients, the kidney is likely to be attacked by immune system and transplant fails.\ntissue typing:\nOut of over 100 different HLA antigens that have been identified, there are six that have been shown to be the most important in organ transplantation. This process involves determining the HLA types of both donor and recipient. It is crucial for assessing compatibility and is closely related to the evaluation of PRA.\npercent reactive antibody (PRA)\nPRA is a metric evaluated for the recipient that measure how many HLA antibodies he/she has in her blood. A higher PRA suggests a higher likelihood of incompatibility with potential donors in general population, making it more challenging to find a matching kidney.\nPRA provides an estimate of the percentage of donors with whom a recipient would be incompatible, reflecting the expected wait time for a transplant.\nserum crossmatch: positive/negative\nA serum crossmatch is a blood test the recipient and the donor will have multiple times, including right before the transplant surgery. Blood from certain donor and recipient are mixed. If the recipient\u0026rsquo;s cells attack and kill the donor cells, the crossmatch is considered positive. If the crossmatch is negative, the pair is considered compatible and surgeries may then be carried out.\n","permalink":"/posts/kidney_exchange111/","summary":"Madonna said \u0026ldquo;strike the pose\u0026rdquo; in Vogue.

This crisis, while nuanced in its manifestation in each country, shares a common thread of financial strain, staffing challenges, and misaligned incentives that put the future of maternity care at risk.\nThe American Struggle\nIn the United States, the situation is particularly dire in rural areas, where more than 200 hospitals have closed their labor and delivery services over the past decade. This trend leaves pregnant individuals in these regions more vulnerable, with higher risks of intensive care unit admission, mortality, and infant mortality. The absence of local maternity care services means that many patients are unable to obtain adequate prenatal or postpartum care, a necessity for ensuring healthy outcomes for both mother and child.\nFinancial challenges are at the heart of this issue. Small rural hospitals struggle to maintain the staffing levels required for around-the-clock delivery services, making it financially unfeasible to support maternity care with the payments per birth that are adequate for larger hospitals. This has led to a staffing crisis, with fewer obstetricians and family physicians willing to take on the demanding schedule required for obstetric care.\nEchoes in China\nThe situation in China mirrors the challenges faced in the US, as highlighted by Professor Tao Deng from Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital Out-patients Building. He expresses a deep concern for the state of obstetrics in China:\n\u0026ldquo;When the general public is worried about dropping birth rates, I am more concerned with the collapse of obstetrics.\u0026rdquo;\nLike in the US, maternity care units in China are costly to operate, requiring a dedicated surgery team to be on call 24/7. Despite the high stakes involved in giving birth, the national pricing for obstetric services remains low, further straining the financial viability of these units.\nThe CMI Index: The Last Straw\nIn China, the introduction of the CMI index-based performance evaluation system has been particularly detrimental. This system penalizes maternity care units for higher rates of natural births, a marker of good performance, leading to a misalignment of hospital incentives that further exacerbates the crisis. Basically, the welfare and initial good will is misaligned with the incentive, and unfortunately, the incentive is strong.\nThe CMI index-based system is emblematic of the broader issues facing maternity care globally: a lack of understanding and support for the unique challenges and costs associated with providing quality obstetric services. This system, along with the financial and staffing challenges, represents the last straw that threatens to break the camel\u0026rsquo;s back, pushing maternity care units to the brink of collapse.\n","permalink":"/posts/news_cmi/","summary":"The maternity care units in both the United States and China are facing a dilemma that threatens the very foundation of obstetric services.

Some are social science majors who might be taking introductory statistics, while others are engineering majors taking advanced calculus. You need some index to measure the average difficulty level of the math classes taken by all these students, say, Stats101 for 1pt while Real Analysis gets 10pt and we\u0026rsquo;ll take arithmetic mean as the difficulty score representing the general course level taken by all the students. In a hospital setting, patients would have different conditions that require different levels of care, resources, and expenses. The Case Mix Index (CMI) is a numerical value that represents the average severity and complexity of patients\u0026rsquo; conditions treated in a hospital or a specific department. A higher CMI indicates more complex and resource-intensive cases.\nAs for Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG), think of it as a way to categorize these students based on the math courses they are taking. Each course (or group of similar courses) is like a DRG, and it has a certain weight assigned to it based on its difficulty and the resources needed to teach it. In the hospital context, DRGs classify patients based on their medical conditions and treatments, and each DRG has a weight that reflects the average resources required to treat patients in that group. This system helps determine how much hospitals get paid for treating patients, ensuring that payments are aligned with the complexity of the care provided.\nMathematically, CMI is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of all patients\u0026rsquo; DRGs. CMI accounts for the complexity and severity of patients\u0026rsquo; conditions, providing a more nuanced, quantifiable view of a hospital\u0026rsquo;s patient population, compared to other raw metrics like the number of patients or procedures, not to mention–revenue. A higher CMI (≥1.5) often indicates that a hospital is using more resources per patient, which can be a sign of providing more specialized or intensive care. It also helps hospitals to better understand their financial performance and, is closely tied to reimbursement rates under systems like Medicare\u0026rsquo;s DRG-based payments.\nDespite being quite a useful, widely admitted and comprehensive metric, setting CMI as the major component of hospital\u0026rsquo;s evaluation would cause problems. It does not align perfectly with the overall objective of medical system: CMI primarily focus on the complexity of cases, but not necessarily the quality of care or patient outcomes. It can be misleading and biased because a hospital specializing in treating complex cases might be naturally advantageous in CMI in the first place. Even worse, CMI is pretty susceptible to gaming: there can be an incentive for hospitals to upcode or document diagnoses in a way that artificially inflates their CMI, or even reducing the number of beds so as to boost the number by lowering the divisor.\nAnd we don\u0026rsquo;t even need an environment to verify the preceding points.

Managing such a busy department, with over a hundred staff members, is a challenging task. In recent years, administrative responsibilities in healthcare management have become increasingly complex, that I can observe a significant surge in her phone call frequency. In 2019, new official guidelines for public hospital performance evaluation were introduced, leading to an annual grading campaign. This evaluation is based on 26 measurable metrics derived from the hospital\u0026rsquo;s operational data.\nThe introduction of this new performance evaluation method has been transformative. It signifies a shift in hospital management from traditional administrative approaches to a comprehensive, KPI-driven model. This change has brought transparency to the system and encouraged hospitals to focus on efficiency optimization rather than mere expansion.\nThe introduced new rules alsmot redefined how the game should be played, shuffling the name list of hospital rankings drastically. Some hospitals have unexpectedly climbed the charts, while others have fallen from their previous positions. For example, XieHe Hospital, traditionally regarded as one of the best, dropped to third place in 2022. The evaluation now covers a broader range of hospital operations, requiring a different strategic approach.\nThe performance evaluation is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;national exam\u0026rdquo; (GuoKao in Chinese). Hospital leaders have quickly adapted, learning to address the metrics efficiently and strategically. The evaluation is structured like an exam paper, with four sections (medical quality, operational efficiency, sustainability, and satisfaction) and a total of 56 factors.\nConsultants break down the exam corresponding to normally how high school teachers analyze GaoKao(the college entrance exam), into basic questions, scoring questions, integrative quesions and extras. The simpler part is the basic questions which correspond to the satisfaction section, and the scoring question about sustainability. Meanwhile, operational efficiency is more comprehensive, which adheres to a hospital\u0026rsquo;s management level and reflects its cost control, income composition etc., which forms an essential part of competition. At last, medical quality is the hardest to improve that is categorized in \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo;, where most hospitals yet don\u0026rsquo;t have the power to control on, such as difficulty of surgeries or research.\nOne might wonder why doctors, already burdened with their medical duties, should concern themselves with these additional metrics. The answer lies in the fact that the evaluation influences various aspects of hospital operations, including financial stipends, health insurance share, leadership appointments, and salaries. Even local governments are invested in this evaluation, as it affects their KPIs as well.\nInitially, the new evaluation system was met with confusion and indifference. However, over time, hospitals have recognized its importance and started to develop strategies to improve their rankings. This evaluation is not just about a numerical rank; it directly impacts resource allocation, financial support, and even government performance.\nWhile the new evaluation system has its detractors and is not without its loopholes, it undeniably represents a significant leap forward in the pursuit of scientific management in healthcare. It\u0026rsquo;s a classic case of the age-old adage: \u0026ldquo;No pain, no gain.\u0026rdquo; Yes, the transition has been fraught with challenges, and the learning curve steep, but the alternative—a stagnant system resistant to change—would be a far graver scenario.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s not forget that at the heart of this seismic shift is the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. It\u0026rsquo;s a reminder that behind the cold hard numbers and metrics are real people whose lives and well-being are at stake. So, while doctors and hospital administrators may grumble about the added workload and pressure, the endgame if not stricly optimal, is surely appearing to be a noble one. As its flaws are identified and addressed, it will undoubtedly become a more effective tool for driving positive change in the healthcare sector.\nAfter all, nothing worthwhile ever comes easy.

For instance, rack up items totaling 300 yuan from participating sellers, and you’re treated to a 40 yuan discount.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s where it gets interesting: TaoBao has a partial refund policy allowing customers to cancel any part of their order before shipment, receiving an instant refund while still retaining the proportional discount. For example, suppose I eye a jacket for ¥120 during a 300-40 campaign. I then add a ¥180 placeholder item to my cart, hitting the 260 mark, and soon after cancel the latter. The jacket\u0026rsquo;s final cost drops to ¥104, exploiting the discount to its fullest.\nThis scenario begs the question: Is TaoBao oblivious to this loophole? Unlikely. The e-commerce behemoth probably turns a blind eye, banking on the fact that most shoppers won\u0026rsquo;t leap through these hoops. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a mix of ethical shopping, the joy of finding more deals, or simply, the hassle that comes with exploiting such loopholes.

If you’re Ariana Grande, you pick yourself up, dust yourself off and head for the studio.\nApple Music\u0026rsquo;s review on Thank U, Next\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a review of the past ten days, as we traversed this melodic odyssey to revisit the ten songs that epitomize her transformative impact on the contemporary music scene. The featured songs in this journey are:\nThe Way (feat. Mac Miller) - journey back to the beginnings of love, where every touch feels like the first. Tattooed Heart - an intimate pledge of everlasting love, inked onto the soul with the indelible ink of affection. Focus - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m over here doing what I like\u0026rdquo;– remember that all you need is to zero in on what truly matters. sweetener - a sugary serenade that adds a spoonful of optimism to the bitter brew of life. goodnight n go - it features the most gorgeous humming in this tender lullaby, that blurs the lines between longing and letting go get well soon - the echoing melody of love and heal imagine - an impossible escape to a world where love knows no bounds and all regrets come true needy - a candid confession of vulnerability, wrapped in the soft embrace of self-awareness 34+35 - a playful romp through the mathematics of desire just like magic - the song that shoud be played every, morning. The list is certainly far from exhaustive. There\u0026rsquo;s Side to Side, the provocatively sexy collaboration with Nicki Minaj that boasts over 2 billion streams on YouTube, singing about the aftermath of intense physical affection. Not to mention the notoriously catchy 7 rings and the ubiquitous thank u, next. But there\u0026rsquo;s more to explore in her repertoire: the exceptionally emotional and intimate love ballads pov and ghostin, the cynical yet playful NASA, and the provocatively titled break up with your girlfriend, i\u0026rsquo;m bored, among others.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s special about Ariana Grande is that, with every released song, there are often one or more half-finished demos that never made it to formal release (and possibly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have, had Ariana not set her iCloud password to \u0026ldquo;Ariana123\u0026rdquo;). Grande\u0026rsquo;s discography is a treasure trove of selective, polished, unblemished masterpieces.\nSo concludes my ten-day embarkation on a musical reflection with Ariana Grande. Each day brought a new appreciation for her artistry and the depth of her music. While this journey through her songs has come to an end, the melodies and messages will continue to resonate with me. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s time to pivot back to the academic world. Until the next musical adventure, may these songs be an inspire or cure if needed. Take care of yourself, and if possible, someone else too.\n","permalink":"/posts/some_more_ariana_grande_music/","summary":"Ariana Grande is a paragon of aesthetic and disposition that I strive to emulate.

That she might finally be experiencing some release, which is what her return album in 2020 Positions sound like.\nPositions is light-heartedly flirtive, reflective of the artist\u0026rsquo;s attitude in both her life and musical pursuit, right before she got engaged and married to Dalton Gomez. A flow of slinky giddiness propels the album. Supple strings, effortless yet perfect vocal runs mixed by scintillating production and absentmindedly playful references all were juxpotased to create a perfected formula that straddled a new line between pop standards, traditional R\u0026amp;B and modern rap production.\nAnyway, it seems that the line between \u0026ldquo;seriously musically inclined\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;just-for-fun\u0026rdquo; does not bind as contraints for Ariana Grande at all, as she dances in supple in her music between these senses. On one side, the songs suffers a bit from their sanitized precisions, but the scrupolous, gorgeous production touched an excellency that is seldom reached in the music industry elsewhere, over these recent years.\nAnd there are 34+35. The second track following the opening track \u0026ldquo;shut up\u0026rdquo;, an elegant, critic-panning middle finger sticked out of layers of swelling strings, pizzicato verse riff, and multi-tracked chorus harmonies. In 34+35, the strings are a little more bouncier, flirtier and sunnier, like a Disney princess singing the praises of sixty-nining while skipping through a meadow surrounded by an audience of doe-eyed animals. Luscious melodies carried out a slew of slinky sexy jams, that the artist almost sang with the angelic, innocent voice possible for \u0026ldquo;can u stay up all night/f*ck me til\u0026rsquo; the daylight?/thirty-four thirty-five\u0026rdquo;. The song\u0026rsquo;s blatantly yelping for love and sex (\u0026ldquo;just gimme them babies\u0026rdquo;) pushes a sense of sweet goofiness to so extreme an extent that renders any blame of vulgar to absurdity.\nReference Positions album review (2020). solrage. sputnik music.\nAlbum review: Positions (2020).

The track is 5 minutes and 22 seconds long, paying respect to the Manchester bombing attack at Ariana’s concert on the 22nd of May 2017. There\u0026rsquo;s 40 seconds of silence at the end of the track, to commemorate those who lost their lives during the attack.\nSo get well soon is basically about mental health, self care and love which composites its mother album\u0026rsquo;s core concepts. Ariana Grande talked about her anxiety that she endured during the Sweetener era:\ni felt like i was floating for like 3 months last year \u0026amp; not in a nice way. Like I [am] outside my body? [It] was very scary and i couldn\u0026rsquo;t breathe well. So it’s about that \u0026amp; lots of voices in my head singin’. I hope it comforts ppl who hear it pls ☁️\nThe song captures the sense of floating, feeling not grounded and overwhelmed by thousands of screaming voices in one\u0026rsquo;s heads: \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s so much in my head did you notice?\u0026rdquo;. Channelling with the chaos, Grande sings striking downbeat counter-melodies of \u0026ldquo;girl what’s wrong witchu come back down\u0026rdquo;. The listening soothes one in luscious harmonies, like a serve of sedative for panic attacks. It’s something approaching miraculous that, being through \u0026ldquo;the worst year of my life\u0026rdquo; as quoted herself, Grande has managed to create and curate an album so devoid of despair, so full of enthusiasm for humanity.\nMusically, the iconoclastic simplicity of the song\u0026rsquo;s piano-accompanied, acapella-like arrangement showcases a sense of minimalism that reflects the confidence of the two writers (Ariana Grande and Pharrell Williams). In contrast to the prevalent trend in contemporary pop music, where tracks are often laden with clamorous beats and instruments to mask their lack of substance, \u0026lsquo;get well soon\u0026rsquo; embraces a stripped-down approach, shedding the superfluous to reveal its core essence.\nGrande co-wrote more songs than usual (10 out of 15) and formed a clear bond with Pharrell Williams, who serves as a songwriter and producer across Sweetener’s stronger half. His funk-lite idiosyncrasies set a bright tone and help elevate the record’s more conventional song structures. Grande and Williams leave themselves plenty of room to play around with texture in clever ways, particularly when it comes to layered vocals and skittering percussion. Set to little more than panting, tongue clicks, and keyboard orbs, “R.E.M” finds novel ways for Grande to expand her vocal repertoire. Singing in a stream of consciousness style about the man in her dreams, she flows in and out of R\u0026amp;B crooning, doo-wop vocal runs, gospel harmonizing, cheeky sing-talking, and a surprisingly precise rap flow (“’Scuse me, um? I love you/I know that’s not the way to start a conversation, trouble”). She doesn’t even need a money note to stamp her mark.\nLike much of Sweetener, the song is musically sparse but encompasses a kaleidoscope of vocal tones. It is here, four albums in, that the true multitudes of her voice, and by extension herself, blossom.\n(btw, R.E.M. (recommend listen to its unreleased video ver. on Bilibili) is another track on Sweetener, also co-written and produced by Pharrell Williams, the two songs resemble in thier style)\nReference: \u0026quot;Sweetener\u0026quot; review by Jill Mapes (2018), Pitchfork.\nAriana Grande, Sweetener review: A portrait of an artist in flux by Kate Solomon (2018), INDEPENDENT.\n","permalink":"/posts/get_well_soon/","summary":"Listen to get well soon on YouTube for the official audio release or the unreleased vide available on Bilibili)\nGet well soon (stylized in all lowercase) is the fifteenth and final track from Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s fourth studio album, Sweetener.

One is that you are able to name numerous reasons, that the song is an artistic marvel, topping the chart, being experimental etc.. Another version of favourite is that some song somehow becomes the go-to song on top of one\u0026rsquo;s mind. When I was picking out the top-k songs, compared to the ones that swing around the borderline that it takes a minute to decide whether it falls above or below the threshold, goodnight n go was picked directly out of the pool and stuffed into the second place among my all-time favourites.\nThe song resonates with listeners on a profound level. It portrays a bittersweet moment in a relationship, when one is encapsulated in the feelings of infatuation. The lyric goes \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s bad enough we get along so well / just say goodnight and go\u0026rdquo; as Ariana sings about being enamored by the person, while saying “goodnight” reflects a deep, implicit expression of affection, the relationship is ephemeral, dreamy and somewhat unreal.\nOverall, the song is well produced and through its versions of intermediate demos one can decipher the design intention. The singer beautifully captures the euphoria and vulnerability of falling in love through her brilliant storytelling skills, and renditioned an euphoric atmosphere with careful voice sampling productions as well as song production.

Yet, the live performance at the Sweetener Sessions in Chicago stands as a testament to her power of cure. In the midst of profound sorrow, Grande channels her pain into strength, aiming to uplift the spirits of her audience. The emotional depth of her agony is palpable as she performs \u0026ldquo;breathin,\u0026rdquo; yet a smile breaks through during the bridge of \u0026ldquo;sweetener\u0026rdquo; as the piano gently shifts to a hopeful major chord, and the lyric reach \u0026ldquo;say i don\u0026rsquo;t know what i\u0026rsquo;d do without you in my life/ it\u0026rsquo;d be so sour\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, her voice dancing along in a rhythmic triplet.\nApart from the original studio recording and the live performances, there exists an unreleased video of Ariana lip-syncing to the song–possibly intended for a visual lyric video. Last but not least, the song was named as the 65th best song of 2018 on Pitchfork\u0026rsquo;s year-end list \u0026ldquo;The 100 Best Songs of 2018\u0026rdquo;:\n“Sweetener” is not subtle. “Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it/Flip it, flip it, flip it,” Ariana Grande instructs on the chorus to her fourth album’s title track, resembling an X-rated game of Bop It. Amid the track’s svelte production—trickling percussion, cushy bass hits, a lusty and cascading synth line—Pharrell punctuates Grande’s commands with a high-pitched “sheesh!” like a steam whistle cutting through the air. It all adds up to a gleeful evocation of sensuality on an album consumed with the heady pleasures of new love.\n“Sweetener” carries a tender streak, too, embracing the notion of finding the good in so much bad, and toasting to the people in one’s life who encourage such perseverance. At a Manchester tribute concert following the deadly bombing at her show there last year, Grande said, “The fact that all of those people were able to turn something that represented the most heinous of humanity into something beautiful and unifying and loving is just wild.” And “Sweetener” embodies that same look-on-the-bright-side universality—a reminder that even the worst feelings can be turned into something radiant and nourishing.\n–Larry Fitzmaurice\n","permalink":"/posts/jason~/","summary":"Listen here: Ariana Grande, “Sweetener”\nThe title track of Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s fourth studio album \u0026ldquo;sweetener\u0026rdquo; (stylized in all lowercase) the pivotal nomination in my top-10 Ariana Grande list.

In this process, \u0026ldquo;Dangerous Woman\u0026rdquo; replaced \u0026ldquo;Focus\u0026rdquo; as the lead single.\nFocus Wiki\nTo view from a higher, music-industry-level perspective, nowadays music is becoming more of an affiliate of an artist\u0026rsquo;s personnel–that the singles and albums are mere means of building and enhancing the artist themselves, while the labels behind are aiming at selling the publicity of the artist, instead of actually collecting the revenue of selling digital or physical albums.\nFocus was meant to be the transition between Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s second album My Everything and following Dangerous Woman, to reflect her shift of personality from a sweet, neighbourhood pop singer to a more popular diva. But Focus didn\u0026rsquo;t meet up the expect of the critics:\nBrennan Carley of Spin noted that Grande\u0026rsquo;s vocals in Focus \u0026ldquo;[lacked] any real excitement from a star who’s got the restraint and skill to take her instrument places most other pop singers can’t anymore\u0026rdquo;.

As a young artist exploring her path, she deserved more tolerance. Grande admitted that the comments were deeply hurtful, yet this period likely contributed to her growth, making her stronger and more resilient and indeed it contributed to a better album. Perhaps this experience underscores the importance of perseverance and the ability to transform criticism into a catalyst for personal development.

This transformation echoes a perspective shared by a friend: \u0026ldquo;If a celebrated work\u0026rsquo;s acclaim seems unwarranted, it\u0026rsquo;s likely you were not its intended audience—at least, not yet.\u0026rdquo;\nThe list of top ten songs is arranged chronologically, beginning with her earliest work today:\nThe Way (feat. Mac Miller) This track is a fusion of R\u0026amp;B and pop, characterized by its retro vibe, light and buoyant beats, and an array of sampling chords and synthesizers. It was the standout single from Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s debut album Yours Truly, climbing to number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and securing the top spot on iTunes. The song starts with Ariana\u0026rsquo;s solo version before Mac Miller (who was romantically involved with Grande at the time) steps in, adding a rap verse while Ariana gracefully steps back.\nThe journey behind the song is profoundly inspiring and has significantly influenced my perspective. At 14, Ariana Grande faced numerous challenges in her quest to create R\u0026amp;B music, akin to her idols Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. She was advised to first gain exposure through TV shows to establish a platform before venturing into R\u0026amp;B music. She did that: \u0026lsquo;I booked that TV show (Victorious), and then I was like, OK, now can I make music?\u0026rsquo; While Victorious marched on, Grande recorded music in her free time and Yours Truly took three years to land. Reflecting on the music video for \u0026ldquo;The Way\u0026rdquo;:\nWe had no budget, didn’t even tell the label that we’re gonna do it. Made it ourselves. We said like, “Listen, we have a camera we have a projector. We have music, we have balloons we got dancers, Brian and Scott.\nWe didn’t have any budget and anything and we just made it, showed it to the label after that. Because before they brought it up to me, were like, we need to shoot a music video. And I was like oh yeah we already did it. Here you go, what do you think. And they were like this is so fun…\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the way you get things done, at least sometimes. This anecdote showcase the proactive and determined attitude that sometimes is the key to achieving one\u0026rsquo;s goals.\nAnd the embellishments that pushed the song into the top ten is the outro after Miller\u0026rsquo;s verse 3, where a major third jump of Grande from the original melody exemplifies the song into a next level.\n","permalink":"/posts/the_way/","summary":"The countdown is on: just ten days until the release of Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s seventh album, Eternal Sunshine.

Here\u0026rsquo;s one answer from Ariana Grande though, in her Vogue 19 cover interview\nAfter years of local children’s theater, Grande landed a role in the Broadway musical 13. (She was 14 at the time.) Weeks after the musical closed, she was cast as the goofy sidekick Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon show Victorious, which made her a star with the tween set. “I never really saw myself as an actress,” she says, “but when I started talking about wanting to make R\u0026amp;B music at 14, they were like, ‘What the fuck would you sing about? This is never going to work. You should audition for some TV shows and build yourself a platform and get yourself out there, because you’re funny and cute and you should do that until you’re old enough to make the music you want to make.’ So I did that. I booked that TV show, and then I was like, OK, now can I make music?” While Victorious marched on, in her free time Grande liked to upload YouTube videos of herself singing covers of Adele, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey. It was a virtuoso rendition of Carey’s “Emotions,” which Grande posted in August 2012, when she was 19, that made her a hot property. Since then she has worked at a frantic pace, turning out five albums in six years, all of them certified platinum, and touring the world three times.\nI recall encountering similar sentiments expressed by CEOs and distinguished scholars, illustrating that it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon for individuals, even those who achieve great success, to initially engage in work that doesn\u0026rsquo;t align with their ultimate aspirations.

This move is not expected to reduce airfare costs directly, yet it signifies a notable shift in the competitive landscape for Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like CTrip, potentially impacting their market share and profitability.\nUnderstanding the mechanics of airline ticket sales is crucial here. Airlines set their flight schedules, seat pricing, and then distribute this information through a Global Distribution System (GDS). OTAs access this data, aggregating flight options for consumers as intermediate information sources without directly influencing ticket supply or pricing. Similarly, railway tickets follow this model, with OTA revenue deriving from commissions, sales bonuses from airlines, and fees for ticket changes and cancellations. They OTAs are notoriously famous for offering overwhelmingly termed insurance contracts for reschedule or refund, and they charge a inflated fee for any uninsured reschedule, not to mention cancellation.\nAnyway, back to the pricing. The preceding is to say that, despite 12306\u0026rsquo;s extensive user base, its entry into the market doesn\u0026rsquo;t disrupt the competition among airlines, who control pricing. Its service offerings, mirroring those of existing OTAs, fail to introduce competitive differentiation or demand stimulation, leaving airfare unaffected. However, this development poses challenges for OTAs, confronting them with a formidable competitor. As consumers grow savvier, avoiding pricing pitfalls and seeking transparency, there\u0026rsquo;s a noticeable shift towards purchasing directly from official sources like 12306 or airline websites, circumventing the complexities of dynamic pricing and data-driven price discrimination.\nCtrip, dominating over half of China\u0026rsquo;s OTA market, faces sustainability challenges as barriers to market entry lower and suppliers (airlines and railways) directly engage with consumers. Moreover, historically, a significant portion of OTA revenue came from inflated refund policies. Now, emerging platforms are eclipsing these outdated practices with greater transparency, efficiency, and a focus on customer experience.\nThis shift doesn\u0026rsquo;t demonize OTAs; it reflects the evolving internet landscape, offering consumers better options for certain purchases. OTAs remain vital for accessing information and booking specialized products like local niche hotels or private inns, where Ctrip\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive database is unparalleled.\nThis instance, along with earlier examples (I and II), illustrates the complex nature of competition. While haphazardly introducing competition into the market can lead to unforeseen challenges, this particular case underscores its potential benefits. It serves as a reminder that, under the right circumstances, competition can drive positive change.\n","permalink":"/posts/plane_ticket_mess/","summary":"Recently, China\u0026rsquo;s primary, stable, all-in-one, state-railway-bureau-directly-operated official railway ticketing platform, 12306, announced an expansion into the airline ticket market.

(Update) covered a topic (sponsored search) that I thought I was familiar with, but after listening, found myself to be pondering with new thoughts. To begin with, the guest list of this episode is already unimaginably fantastic:\nSOURCES Marissa Mayer, co-founder of Sunshine; former C.E.O. of Yahoo! and vice president at Google. Ryan McDevitt; professor of economics at Duke University. Tim Hwang, media researcher and author; former Google employee. Elizabeth Reid, vice president of Search at Google. Aravind Srinivas, C.E.O. and co-founder of Perplexity. Jeremy Stoppelman, C.E.O. and co-founder of Yelp. And it mentioned several interesting new facts. Particularly, the process of how PageRank was integrated as Google Search\u0026rsquo;s core algorithm. I used to took it as granted, but well, idea don\u0026rsquo;t just grow on chips:\nA search query produced a long list of sites, in seemingly random order, and you would have to page through hundreds or thousands of links to find what you needed. Sergey Brin and Larry Page thought they could do better. In 1996 — when they were grad students at Stanford — they created a search engine built upon a clever algorithm called PageRank. As in Larry Page but also as in ranking your search results by page. Theoretically, the most useful result would be at the top of the first page of results. Think about a newspaper, if you can remember back that far: the important stories of the day were on the front page, A1; the less-important stuff was tucked inside. That’s what PageRank was going for. And how did it do that? Brin and Page had applied an insight from the world of academic research, where the most important research papers are the ones that are most often cited in the bibliographies of other papers. The web didn’t have bibliographic citations, but it did have links. So when PageRank looked at a given web page, it would see how many other pages linked to it. The most important pages, they theorized, would have lots of links pointing to them from other pages — and then the algorithm looked at how important those pages were, based on incoming links. Their mission, they said, was “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”\nAnd a research about AAA-plumber and misplaced incentive for consumer\u0026rsquo;s attention: back then, you call housing service by looking up on a yellow page book, and when one opens a yellow page there are people whose names are\n\u0026ldquo;A-AAAA Sewer And Drains. AAAA Scots Plumbing. It’s just, like, ridiculous names.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy did all these plumbers have such ridiculous names? Well, in a format like the Yellow Pages — whose listings were alphabetical — those plumbers’ listings would appear at the top of the plumbing category.\nToday the AAAs on Yellow Pages becomes the sponsored search on Google. McDevitt argues, the same logic applies: firms that do everything they can do grab a customer’s attention are not competing on quality. And here a part of the conversation in the podcast that is really interesting:\nMcDEVITT: Now you’re blanketing Google with a bunch of listings. You are blanketing Google Maps with a bunch of listings. You’re trying to win the first ad slot on Google just like you try to get the biggest ad in the Yellow Pages. All these behaviors are consistent with the story — you’re trying to attract uninformed consumers who aren’t going to search a lot.\nDUBNER: So if I’m reading this correctly, your research showed that plumbing firms that advertise on Google have 13 times as many complaints as firms that don’t. First of all, am I misreading that? Thirteen times is the actual magnitude?\nMcDEVITT: That was the right number back in 2007, ’08, when I was pulling the data. So it’s a big difference. And again, the logic is the ones that are trying to attract these one-off customers who are searching quickly, those are the ones that you can rip off.\nDUBNER: I’ve seen other research on position auctions for Google advertising — this is from Susan Athey and Glen Ellison, I believe — which says that position auctions actually make search more efficient, and they sort firms from high- to low-quality. Do you agree with that?\nMcDEVITT: You know, it’s a theory paper and as a theory paper, a beautiful paper. It depends a lot on the assumptions in the setting. And so they did not have plumbers in mind when they wrote that paper. What’s different in the setting of plumbers is the costs are very different, the profits are going to be very different if you’re not providing the service in a legitimate way, if you’re a fly-by-night plumbing firm, you know, those are the ones are going to be most profitable and get the most value from winning the auction.\nThe podcast is mindblowingly eye-opening, there are plenty of fresh thoughts and juicy facts to learn from. It offers a deeper glimpse into the industry and alternative perspectives from industry leaders and insiders. Just go and listen, I\u0026rsquo;ll recommend it with five stars.\n","permalink":"/posts/what_happened_to_google/","summary":"The latest episode of Freakonomics podcast titled Is Google Getting Worse?

The essence of music theory, particularly in the analysis of chords, mirrors an advanced form of modular arithmetic, showcasing a mathematical elegance. Musical scores serve as encoded scripts of melodies, awaiting decryption and performance. Particularly, Johann Sebastian Bach epitomizes this blend of mathematical intricacy and artistic beauty, standing as a paragon of the fusion between the two realms.\nAn enlightening post by Elise Cutts in Scientific American unveils how physicists have discerned mathematical patterns within Bach\u0026rsquo;s compositions, patterns that enrich the conveyance of information. Through a novel representation of musical scores as networks—comprising nodes (dots) interconnected by edges (lines)—this research quantifies the informational content across hundreds of Bach’s works.\nBy representing scores as simple networks of dots, called nodes, connected by lines, called edges, scientists quantified the information conveyed by hundreds of Bach’s compositions.\n\u0026hellip;\nSo Kulkarni boiled down 337 Bach compositions into webs of interconnected nodes and calculated the information entropy of the resulting networks. In these networks, each note of the original score is a node, and each transition between notes is an edge. For example, if a piece included an E note followed by a C and a G played together, the node representing E would be connected to the nodes representing C and G.\nNetworks of note transitions in Bach’s music packed more of an informational punch than randomly generated networks of the same size—the result of greater variation in the networks’ nodal degrees, or the number of edges connected to each node. Additionally, the scientists uncovered variation in the information structure and content of Bach’s many compositional styles. Chorales, a type of hymn meant to be sung, yielded networks that were relatively sparse in information, though still more information-rich than randomly generated networks of the same size. Toccatas and preludes, musical styles that are often written for keyboard instruments such as the organ, harpsichord and piano, had higher information entropy.\nThe original paper Information content of note transitions in the music of J. S. Bach is out in Phys. Rev. Research\u0026rsquo;s on Feb. 6th, 2024. As stated in the paper, \u0026ldquo;our simple framework serves as a stepping stone for exploring further musical complexities, creativity, and questions therein\u0026rdquo;.

First learnt this in Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s Sweetener album tracks\u0026rsquo; all-lowercase namings and initially trying just for fun, I found this way of styled writing extremely comfortable so that it eventually forms into a habit. This seemingly personal preference however, coincides with a latest trend of writing style, especially among Gen Z.\nAriana Grande\u0026rsquo;s iconic, abusive use of all-lowercase writings in her social media posts, do do her fans. Mariah Carey though (see her reply in the lower left corner), still uses the gramatically correct way of typing, even on Instagram.\nKristin Merrilees\u0026rsquo;s Why Gen Z Made Capitalization Irrelevant provides a crash course about this anti-capitalization movement. Yet while she and a lot of people are simply classifying it as another internet language mutation, the lowercase trend has a longer history, a more nuanced motive and a more persistent popularity: Speaking of history, E. E. Cummings (or e. e. cummings) and Steve Jobs did this in their published poems and signatures. From a technical point of view, all-lowercase is faster to type, especially on mobile devices. More generally, all-lowercase reduces the trouble of styling and the tiny but irritating friction one would come across in writing when faced with a whether-to-cap-it-or-not dilemma. Readability is also an issue. Lower case texts are more consistent and smooth to read through, and are more pleasing to look at for some reason. While most internet slangs come and go (for example, abusively using ~tildes~ or *asterisks*), all lowercase seems to be persistently seeding in a lot of the young generation\u0026rsquo;s writing habit.\nPerhaps for an internet-age issue, consulting formal blogs for an answer doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that much. And here\u0026rsquo;s a reply on Quora that, in my perspective, best explained this matter:\nFirstly, I’ll clarify stuff a little. I’m a teen myself, and if you ask me, we type in two ways that are like yin and yang to each other. One is all lowercase, abbreviating words (like “you” to “u”, “yeah” to “yea” or “really” to “rly”) and skipping apostrophes. The other is using more correct capitalization and punctuation, filling your text messages with metaphors and subjectivity adverbs and even using bolds and italics. And there’s barely an in-between between these two extremes.\nBoth happen because of aesthetic and psychological reasons.\nTyping a whole text message of lowercase letters suggests kind of a laidback attitude, which is why a portion of people may choose this way of typing. Another reason is that, because there are no caps, the message itself feels more stable. Plus, people who type that way often think that using caps well feels too raw, so they prefer to take them out, strengthening the calmness they’d want to convey. Some others might do it because, in a way, it has become kind of a cult. And maybe that’s why that typing style is more expanded and stereotyped to Generation Z than the other. Obviously, no one would type that way in an essay or something more formal, but only in social media.\nOn the other hand, using an elaborated grammar and punctuation couldn’t feel as chill or laidback as an “all lowercase” message, but kind of the opposite. I think it feels more honest and expressive. Also more joyful and energetic. And that’s mainly why that other percentage of teenagers, myself included, prefer to type this way. And you’d ask me: If you always use a correct grammar and punctuation, how can I know you’re in your schoolwork or you’re just talking to your bestie? So if I want to be formal, I’ll speak more literally and go straight to the point, but when I’m speaking to my friends or my crush, I might be more metaphorical and use adverbs that suggest subjectivity, along a much more street-like language. And if I want to sound cute, I’d recur to repeating the last letter of a word/sentence (like when I say “Thankssss”). That combined with a more expressive way of explaining yourself is just adorable. And, just like in the first case, I wouldn’t fill an essay with metaphors, subjectivity adverbs, bolds and italics; that way of typing only rises in informal situations as well.\nAnyways, I really hope you understand why our generation types in these two completely different ways.\nCutieJewel. (All right belongs to the original author)\nBtw, there are people criticizing that teens do this because they want to be edgy. It might be a partially reason but there\u0026rsquo;s more: it\u0026rsquo;s a choice of aesthetic,\nluscious lowercase letters flow across the computer screen with such aplomb, such cadence, that the viewer can’t help but sigh in sheer appreciation for the author’s words.. the words that flow on and on without a break, without a hitch.\nFelicia Green\u0026rsquo;s reply to Why do edgy teens type in all lowercase on Quora?

Deep-fake videos and news are generating misleading information towards public. For AI developers who relies on internet-based text corpus to train new AI versions, they are finding their relied sources being polluted by AI generations. Hence, how to detect such trickery is a live topic among ai researchers. There are two primary ways of detection: some firms offer software that aims to spot machine-generated media; others, like the makers of big ai models, meanwhile, are searching for ways of “watermarking” their output so that real pictures, video or text can be readily distinguished from the machine-generated sort.\nThe Economist conducted a (deeply unscientific) straw poll of delegates to Neurips. Of 23 people asked, 17 thought ai-generated media would eventually become undetectable. Only one believed that reliable detection would be possible. (The other five demurred, preferring to wait and see.)\nFor text:\nOne technique for marking text was proposed by a team at the University of Maryland in July 2023, and added to by a team at University of California, Santa Barbara, who presented their tweaks at Neurips. The idea is to fiddle with a language model’s word preferences. First, the model randomly assigns a clutch of words it knows to a “green” group, and puts all the others in a “red” group. Then, when generating a given block of text, the algorithm loads the dice, raising the probability that it will plump for a green word instead of one of its red synonyms. Checking for watermarking involves comparing the proportion of green to red words—though since the technique is statistical, it is most reliable for longer chunks of writing.\nFor images (and hence also videos):\nMany methods for watermarking images, meanwhile, involve tweaking the pixels in subtle ways, such as shifting their colours. The alterations are too subtle for human observers to notice, but can be picked up by computers. But cropping an image, rotating it, or even blurring and then resharpening it can remove such marks.\nAnother group of researchers at Neurips presented a scheme called “Tree-Ring” watermarking that is designed to be more robust. Diffusion models, the most advanced type of image-generation software, begin by filling their digital canvas with random noise, out of which the required picture slowly emerges. The tree-ring method embeds the watermark not in the finished picture, but in the noise at the start. If the software that created a picture is run in reverse, it will reproduce the watermark along with the noise. Crucially, the technique is less easy to thwart by fiddling with the final image.\nHowever, the situation has almost become an arm race between the detectors and the AI-developers:\nAnother team led by Hanlin Zhang, Benjamin Edelman and Boaz Barak, all of Harvard University, presented a method (not yet peer-reviewed) that can, they say, erase watermarks. It works by adding a dash of new noise, then using a second, different ai model to remove that noise, which removes the original watermark in the process. They claim to be able to foil three new text-watermarking schemes proposed in 2023. In September scientists at the University of Maryland published a paper (also not yet peer-reviewed) claiming that none of the current methods of image watermarking—Tree-Rings included—is foolproof.\nThe application of AI detection would be immensely case-dependent. Despite we could already name dozens of particular applicaion cases where abusive use of AI generated content would create negative impact, to precisely define the application scenario hence framing a working boundary for such detection requires thorough work that bridge current academic findings with robust industrial usage.\n","permalink":"/posts/ai_detection_deepfake/","summary":"Make the AI dance in certain ways, they would eventually stumble.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a new story from the economist about fake-news new:\nMany AI researchers think fakes will become undetectable AI created contents that are indetectably mixed within genuine \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; human products are causing a lot of troubles.

From a macro perspective, its structure transcends the basic two-sided model of buyers and sellers. This market encompasses multiple stakeholders: cinemas, filmmakers (including actors and directors) and their production companies, ticketing platforms, rating agencies, social media, and, crucially, the consumers themselves. These Spring-Festical films are typically produced months in advance, with release dates often aligned with the Spring Festival holidays. They are usually family-friendly comedies, are specifically designed for holiday viewing and might not hold the same appeal outside this context. This creates a marketplace with diverse goods (of small variance), almost invariable supply, and flexible pricing mechanisms—ticket prices can fluctuate, and cinemas have the autonomy to schedule screenings.\nAdvertising campaigns are a pivotal aspect of this market. Significant budgets are allocated to ads aimed at convincing families to choose specific films over others, or simply to entice them into theaters. Strategies for boosting exposure include employing bots to inflate ratings on review platforms and orchestrating social media campaigns to generate buzz. While these tactics can increase visibility, their effectiveness in persuading genuine audience interest is debatable.\nTicket pricing strategies offer another dimension of intrigue. Cinemas wield considerable influence over both film selection and ticket pricing, presenting a classic optimization challenge: dynamically adjusting prices and seating allocations to maximize revenue. The introduction of ticketing platforms complicates this landscape, creating a hybrid information and purchasing network for consumers. This can lead to pricing disparities where identical seats are sold at significantly different prices, sometimes with a 50% variance.\nThis happens recently with one of my friends. He and his family went to watch Andy Law\u0026rsquo;s new film \u0026lsquo;The Movie Emperor\u0026rsquo;. They bought two tickets on Douyin (Chinese TikTok) and the remaining one on another platform. Despite the three tickets are for the same time and adjacent seats, their price is significantly different.\nHowever, the competitive zeal can sometimes lead to consumer disillusionment. For instance, my experience with \u0026ldquo;PEGASU 2\u0026rdquo; was marred by misleading high ratings and an inflated sense of popularity, likely the result of strategic manipulation rather than genuine acclaim. The film suffered from a disjointed plot, sluggish pacing, and lackluster audio-visual quality, failing to meet the expectations set by its promotional efforts.

And con- ditional on obfuscation being optimal, it may not be optimal to hide all information, but will, in general, be optimal to partially reveal information. This issue already arises in the case of one player with no prior information.\nBergemann and Morris (JEL 2019), Information Design: A unified Perspective\nIn the game of love, if we\u0026rsquo;re not thinking about the long-term impact of our actions but merely focusing on getting the other person to behave a certain way, the best strategy is to be a master of ambiguity.

The model is very inspiring for an OM project I\u0026rsquo;m working on recently, whereas its mathematical method and results are immensely useful to learn from for another problem that I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on for a while.\nIs Selling Complete Information (Approximately) Optimal?\nDirk Bergemann, Yang Cai, Grigoris Velegkas, and Mingfei Zhao. 2022.\nABSTRACT\nWe study the problem of selling information to a data-buyer who faces a decision problem under uncertainty. We consider the classic Bayesian decision-theoretic model pioneered by Blackwell. Initially, the data buyer has only partial information about the payoff-relevant state of the world. A data seller offers additional information about the state of the world. The information is revealed through signaling schemes, also referred to as experiments. In the single-agent setting, any mechanism can be represented as a menu of experiments. A recent paper by Bergemann et al.[8] present a complete characterization of the revenue-optimal mechanism in a binary state and binary action environment. By contrast, no characterization is known for the case with more actions. In this paper, we consider more general environments and study arguably the simplest mechanism, which only sells the fully informative experiment. In the environment with binary state and m≥3 actions, we provide an $O(m)$-approximation to the optimal revenue by selling only the fully informative experiment and show that the approximation ratio is tight up to an absolute constant factor. An important corollary of our lower bound is that the size of the optimal menu must grow at least linearly in the number of available actions, so no universal upper bound exists for the size of the optimal menu in the general single-dimensional setting. We also provide a sufficient condition under which selling only the fully informative experiment achieves the optimal revenue.\nFor multi-dimensional environments, we prove that even in arguably the simplest matching utility environment with 3 states and 3 actions, the ratio between the optimal revenue and the revenue by selling only the fully informative experiment can grow immediately to a polynomial of the number of agent types. Nonetheless, if the distribution is uniform, we show that selling only the fully informative experiment is indeed the optimal mechanism.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a brief summarize of the model used, and a few commentaries.\n[WRITE it]\nConsider a decision game of uncertainty. There are $n$ possible states and $m$ actions with each combination $i\\in [n], j\\in [m]$ yields outcome $u_{ij}$, which is universally known. Denote the matrix of $u_{ij}$ as $U$. States are unknown aprior known and buyer has a private belief (prior), denoted as $\\mathbf \\theta\\in \\R^{n-1}$ where $\\theta_i$ is the probability for state $i ,i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n-1$ to occur (notice that for $i = n $, probability is given bby $1 - \\sum_i \\theta_i$, hence for $n$ states, a vector of $n - 1$ dimensions suffices).\nThe sold information, or an experiment $\\mathbf E$ as described in the paper, is a signaling scheme that the seller commit to. It can be described as a matrix $\\pi \\in \\mathbb R^{n\\times m}$ where $\\pi_{ij}$ corresponds to when state is $i$, action $j$ is recommended (revelation principle). After receiving an recommendation, say, action $k\\in [m]$, the buyer updates his belief to a posterior, according to Baye\u0026rsquo;s law: $$ P[w = i|k, \\theta] = \\frac{\\theta_i \\pi_{ik}}{\\sum_{l\\in [n]} \\theta_l \\pi_{lk}}, \\forall i = [n] $$ and decides the best action using the posterior: $$ a(k|\\theta) = \\arg\\max_{j\\in [m]} \\frac{\\sum_{i\\in [n]}\\theta_i \\pi_{ik}u_{ij}}{\\sum_{i\\in [n]} \\theta_i \\pi_{ik}}. $$ A given experiment $\\mathbf E$ yields expected utility for type $\\theta$ to be $V_\\theta(\\mathbf E) = \\sum_{k\\in [m]} \\max_{j\\in [m]}{\\sum_{i\\in [n]} \\theta_i \\pi_{ik} u_{ij}}$.\nThen, a mechanism to ilicit information $\\theta\\in \\Theta$ can be described as a pair of matching ${E(\\theta), t(\\theta)}_{\\theta \\in \\Theta}$, where $E(\\theta)$ is the experiment buyer gets allocated and $t(\\theta)$ is the payment. The mechanism\u0026rsquo;s IR/IC constraints can be defined pretty intuitively thereof.\nThe paper studies the scenario when it is assumed that $\\theta$ drawn out of some given distribution, and attempt to approximate the optimal revenue when selling for completel information. The result is that, under binary state with $m$ actions, the optimal revenue is $O(m)$ times the revenue of simply selling full information. And, selling a menu of semi-informative experiments can achieve constant approximated revenue of optimal selling.\nWill read the math details and literature reviews and write an update later, say, hopefully within this week.

Smith\u0026rsquo;s perspective on higher education, as discussed in a recent episode of the podcast People I (Mostly) Admire, titled \u0026ldquo;Higher Education Is Broken. Can It Be Fixed?\u0026rdquo; . Btw, the podcast itself is part of the Freakonomics network, the academically inclined perspective is particularly sweetspot for an econ student.\nThis episode elucidates the systemic flaws plaguing the U.S. higher education system. One pov involves diving into the market power of colleges.\nLEVITT: So let’s talk about that status quo. You argue that our current system of higher education is built on three scarcities. Can you explain what you mean by that?\nSMITH: When we talk about market power, you get market power by being able to do something or controlling some sort of resource that your competitors don’t control or can’t do. And at least when I looked at that in the context of higher education, I think higher education power derives from being able to control access to the scarce seats in the classroom, access to the scarce faculty experts, and access to the valuable credentials that help you get good high paying jobs.\nLEVITT: Let’s cover those one by one. You’re saying that there’s a scarcity of access to seats in the classroom. What do you mean by that?\nSMITH: What I mean by that is — you know, my wife and I have had three kids apply to college, and if you type into Google almost any college’s name, the autofill will be “acceptance rate.” One of the key ways we measure quality is proportionally how few students get admitted. Controlling access to those scarce seats becomes a key source of power.\nLEVITT: That makes perfect sense. Now, your second scarcity was the scarcity in instruction. What do you mean by that?\nSMITH: What I mean by that is access to faculty experts. So in the book, I talk about my advisor, Eric Brynjolfsson, Catherine Tucker, Ed McFowland, Natalia Levina, and the point I make is: if you want to learn from Eric Brynjolfsson, you’ve got to get admitted to Stanford. And if you want to learn from Catherine Tucker, you’ve got to get admitted to M.I.T. And on down the line. And I think it’s the powerful universities who control access to those experts, however we define that.\nLEVITT: That makes sense. So the faculty teach the students at the university primarily. They don’t teach the general public. If you want me to lecture to you, then you got to come to the University of Chicago. Okay. Now the third scarcity you mentioned is credentials. What do you mean by that?\nSMITH: What I mean by that is controlling access to the really high value credential. And here I’m going to say university brand name — that how people are perceived in the job market, at least early in their career, is heavily dependent on the brand name of the university they graduated from. Getting a degree from the University of Chicago is going to get you a whole lot farther in the marketplace than University X.\nLEVITT: I’m glad you said X. I wondered what university you were going to disparage.\nSMITH: I’ve already pissed off enough people. I’m trying to minimize it as much as possible.\nLEVITT: So the elite schools admit very few students. They have big name faculty that people would like to learn from, but can’t because they don’t go to that school. And then when you graduate with this degree, it gives you a big reward. And the bottom line of all of that is that universities have a ton of market power, especially the elite ones, and they charge really high sticker prices as a result of that. And in your own words, you described the current situation as financially and morally unsustainable. And that’s why you’ve written this book is because you think that higher education is completely and totally broken.\nThis market power is not only strong but persistent as well:\nLEVITT: Arguably higher education has been the most stable industry in America over the last hundred years. I went back trying to find a ranking of the top schools. I found a ranking from 1910 and the top five schools in 1910, so 113 years ago, were Harvard, University of Chicago, Columbia, Yale, and Cornell. MIT was 10th, Princeton was 14th, Stanford was 15th. Really, you know, the same set of schools are there. And just for fun, I went back and I looked at the highest market capitalization companies, and I found from 1917 that the five biggest companies in America by value were: U.S. Steel, AT\u0026amp;T, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Bethlehem Steel, and Armour and Company, which I had to go look it up — they were a meatpacking company. So the economy has been completely transformed. Higher education hasn’t. So what in the world makes you think that we’re at the cusp of a radical change in higher education when everything else points the opposite direction?\nAt last, something fun for a bedtime sweetener:\nSMITH: I think a college degree has become more important in the job market over the course of the last 40 years. I also think that the U.S. News and World Report rankings have become more important over the last 40 years. And only 25 universities can be in the top 25 at any given time.\nLEVITT: I don’t know if this is really true. At least in economics, there’s maybe eight schools in the top three, 25 schools in the top 10, and about 50 in the top 25. I don’t know, I think you got something wrong with the math there.\nSMITH: It’s a limited number in the top 25.

It\u0026rsquo;s possible that there exists another body of literature I\u0026rsquo;m yet to discover; however, the current economic literature, particularly on information design, lacks a clear outline of a real-world data trading market. Moreover, with the rise of generative AI, the valuation of data, such as labeled data coveted by tech giants for exclusivity, needs reevaluation to align with AI training standards.\nNow, about data trading\u0026hellip; here\u0026rsquo;s all the problems: Following our dip into the industry of data trading yesterday and some thinkings about that data trading markets are far less nuanced yet, here\u0026rsquo;s a summary of my readings. Today, all about shits happening in this industry:\nA notable challenge is the reluctance and bureaucratic hurdles associated with data trading. The absence of a widely accessible public data market platform is not coincidental. Operating such a platform openly involves extensive legal documentation, intricate in details and terms of use, which perpetuates a preference for private, ad hoc transactions.\nPeople do not know how much their data are worth, nor do they really want to deal with the hassle of managing them.\nData would not be the only important resource which is not widely traded; witness radio spectrum and water rights. But for data this is likely to create inefficiencies, argues Mr Weyl. If digital information lacks a price, valuable data may never be generated.\nAnother critical issue is the digital hand to be wary of. Data equates to power. When tech giants control vast amounts of data, they dominate the market, capable of preemptively identifying and absorbing emerging startups, thereby monopolizing innovation. The solution seems straightforward: enforce stricter anti-trust laws or, more radically:\nAnother idea is to promote alternatives to centralised piles of data. Governments could give away more of the data they collect, creating opportunities for smaller firms.\nThe complex landscape of data science and AI technology complicates the regulation of personal data use. Though managing data through a unified account per individual sounds feasible, practical implementation remains elusive. The rapid advancement of technology outpaces regulatory efforts, adding layers of complexity when intertwining privacy and competition concerns:\nAnd there is another tension between tighter data protection and more competition: not only have big companies greater means to comply with pricey privacy regulation, it also allows them to control data more tightly.\nThe myriad of challenges and emerging perspectives makes it difficult to envision a future devoid of digital technology and data-driven insights. Imagine a future where our data trades are as common as swapping baseball cards in the schoolyard: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll trade you three insights on consumer behavior for your latest trend analysis on tech startups\u0026rdquo;. And in the spirit of keeping things interesting, perhaps we should introduce trading stickers for data scientists, complete with holographic charts and sparkly algorithms. After all, if we\u0026rsquo;re destined to surf the waves of data, we might as well make it a beach party.\n","permalink":"/posts/data_trading_economist1/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m reading some papers about mechanism design on pricing of information, following up on this data trading reading session\nBergemann et al.

China established several state-owned data exchange centers (e.g. Shanghai Data Exchange) and they are gradually building momentum recently because of the generative-AI booming bubble. But it\u0026rsquo;s not a new thing. An early article \u0026lsquo;Data is giving rise to a new economy\u0026rsquo; sort of predicted the prosperous market seven years ago (The Economist, May 6th 2017).\nData are to this century what oil was to the last one: a driver of growth and change. Flows of data have created new infrastructure, new businesses, new monopolies, new politics and—crucially—new economics. Digital information is unlike any previous resource; it is extracted, refined, valued, bought and sold in different ways.\n\u0026ndash; The Economist, Data is giving rise to a new economy - How is it shaping up?\nThe metaphor is marvelous. Data is the fuel of our digital age. Just as how people are obsessed with oil decades ago (and even now), the same applies for data. There is already a booming industry revolving around data and a new ecology is shaping up. Most importanly, because data\u0026rsquo;s value is increasing, it\u0026rsquo;s evolving from a good into an asset. There are the data majors, a growing number of wildcatters and plenty of other firms trying to get a piece of the action.\nFor example, those giant tech companies such as Uber or Tesla are able to collect their user\u0026rsquo;s data tro train their own AI models so as to increase performance, hence attracting more consumers and on and on:\n\u0026hellip;to exploit a powerful economic engine called the “data-network effect”—using data to attract more users, who then generate more data, which help to improve services, which attracts more users.\nFor other smaller businesses,:\n“Data-driven” startups are the wildcatters of the new economy: they prospect for digital oil, extract it and turn it into clever new services, from analysing X-rays and CAT scans to determining where to spray herbicide on a field. Nexar, an Israeli startup, has devised a clever way to use drivers as data sources. Its app turns their smartphones into dashcams that tag footage of their travels via actions they normally perform. If many unexpectedly hit the brake at the same spot on the road, this signals a pothole or another obstacle. As compensation for using Nexar’s app, drivers get a free dashcam and services, such as a detailed report if they have an accident. The firm’s goal is to offer all sorts of services that help drivers avoid accidents—and for which they, or their insurers, will pay. One such is alerts about potholes or when a car around a blind corner suddenly stops.\nYet, there are problem of exclusiveness in the data world. The market of data is still building up from scratch (at least back in 2017). All those information cost, egotiating deals, enforcing contracts and so on—make it simpler and more efficient simply to bring these activities in-house. Also, the nature of how data work to generate value (train-deploy-test) makes it almost impossible to estimate value of data ex ante. The pricing difficulty and repunancy emotion of trading data showcased the obstacles and opportunities.\nOil is the world’s most traded commodity by value. Data, by contrast, are hardly traded at all, at least not for money. That is a far cry from what many had in mind when they talked about data as a “new asset class”, as the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Davos conference-organiser-cum-think-tank, did in a report published in 2011. The data economy, that term suggests, will consist of thriving markets for bits and bytes. But as it stands, it is mostly a collection of independent silos.\nNotably, speaking of repugnancy of trading data, those data brokers who sell all our personal information seem like something that should be be banned. But here\u0026rsquo;s another view:\nIt took decades for well-functioning markets for oil to emerge. Ironically, it was Standard Oil, the monopoly created by John D. Rockefeller in the late-19th century, that speeded things up: it helped create the technology and—the firm’s name was its programme—the standards that made it possible for the new resource to be traded.\nMarkets have long existed for personal data that are of high value or easy to standardise. So-called “data brokers” do a swift trade in certain types of data. In other areas, markets, or something akin to them, are starting to develop.\nOracle, which dominates the market for corporate databases, for example, is developing what amounts to an exchange for data assets. It wants its customers to trade data, combine them with sets provided by Oracle and extract insights—all in the safe environment of the firm’s computing cloud, where it can make sure, among other things, that information is not misused. Cognitive Logic, a startup, has come up with a similar product, but leaves the data in separate IT systems.\nFollowing up, tmrw will be an extension of this topic.\n","permalink":"/posts/data_trading_economist/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been researching on data trading.

It stars Rachel Brosnahan as Miriam \u0026ldquo;Midge\u0026rdquo; Maisel, a New York housewife who discovers her knack for stand-up comedy and embarks on a journey to build a career in it. The show\u0026rsquo;s fifth and final season premiered and concluded in May 2023 on Amazon Prime Videos.\nI reserved MMM for my winter holiday, creating the perfect viewing environment: curtains drawn, room darkened, a stark contrast to watching some other shows on a gym treadmill (miserable\u0026hellip;). This setting brought back high school memories and highlighted the growth of both myself and the characters over the years. It was a magical experience to see how much more I could understand and appreciate in the series compared to my initial viewing.\nHere are three standout aspects of MMM that underscore its brilliance and serve as persuasive points for its must-watch status.\nThe Fashionista\u0026rsquo;s Dream: Costume Design The wardrobe of Midge Maisel is nothing short of fabulous, reminiscent of a nostalgic \u0026ldquo;Mean Girls\u0026rdquo; (2004), where characters wear their clothes rather than being overshadowed by them. Midge\u0026rsquo;s ever-changing outfits are a testament to the show\u0026rsquo;s attention to detail and dedication to period authenticity. In a delightful nod to this wardrobe feat, season five, episode two humorously acknowledges the sheer volume of costumes acquired.\nS5E02. The then-famous Midge announced that she will auction all her clothes for charity, walking down a long isle to cutely addressing the maximalism of her wardrobe.\nDonna Zakowska, the two-time Emmy award-winning costume designer, masterfully uses color to reflect Midge\u0026rsquo;s emotional journey, likening her coats to \u0026ldquo;multi-colored armor\u0026rdquo; or a superhero\u0026rsquo;s cape, empowering her as she navigates her comedy career.\n“I used color to depict [Midge’s] emotional landscape and give emphasis to moments in which she needed to be particularly comic or heroic or even proactive,” Zakowska wrote in her book Madly Marvelous: The Costumes of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. “I started to refer to her coats as ‘multi-colored armor.\u0026rsquo; I considered [them] to be the equivalent of a superhero cape—transfiguring, protective, emotional armor that emboldens and empowers her as a character.”\nNostalgic Escapism MMM\u0026rsquo;s early seasons are a masterclass in escapism, with the Catskills episode (season 2, episode 4) being a prime example. The Weissman family\u0026rsquo;s annual summer trip to Steiner\u0026rsquo;s Resort in the Catskill Mountains is depicted with such artistry and nostalgia for the 1950s that it leaves a lasting impact on the viewer\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities. This episode, a dreamy kaleidoscope of pastel colors and leisurely summer activities, effortlessly transports viewers to a bygone era.\nSee this clip for a glimpse. Spoiler alert, the \u0026ldquo;chicken fat\u0026rdquo; bgm really stunned me for how groundbreakingly it suits the scene and everything.\nNarrative Depth The introduction of flashbacks in season five has been met with mixed reviews, but I argue it elevates MMM to new heights, making it one of Amazon\u0026rsquo;s most ambitious series. Through Midge\u0026rsquo;s trials and tribulations in the cutthroat show business, the series reveals the harsh realities behind the glamour.\n[Midge] It\u0026rsquo;s always two steps forward, three steps back and I\u0026rsquo;m tired of it.\nIt breaks the bubble to the stark reality. From being dropped by Shy Baldwin to toiling as a writer on Gordon Ford\u0026rsquo;s show, Midge\u0026rsquo;s journey from a betrayed housewife to a rising comedy star is fraught with challenges, underscoring the resilience and tenacity required to succeed.\nAnyway To conclude, words barely scratch the surface of \u0026ldquo;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; splendor. This series is a testament to the power of storytelling, costume design, and character development, wrapped in a package of humor and historical reflection. I cannot recommend it enough. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n","permalink":"/posts/mmm/","summary":"costume, escapism and narrative depth - a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ show to watch.","title":"the magnificent, magical, marvelous mrs Maisel"},{"content":"Sabrina Carpenter\u0026rsquo;s hit Nonsense is a great song, both artistically and commercially.

Cash payments at restaurants are cumbersome, and checks are unreliable. The advent of digital card payments introduced a more convenient alternative for consumers. Credit cards generate interest for issuers, as they essentially lend money. However, this innovation doesn\u0026rsquo;t benefit every market segment equally.\nCredit card issuers operate in a space between monopolistic competition and oligopoly, characterized by high barriers to entry due to network effects—a platform that bridges consumers and businesses, where both diners and restaurants prefer the other side to be as extensive as possible. Credit card companies offer cashbacks to cardholders, while businesses pay transaction fees for their services. These cashbacks and exclusive discounts, funded by the transaction fees charged to businesses, are a way for credit card companies to indirectly compete. This structure allows companies to shift competition \u0026ldquo;behind the curtain,\u0026rdquo; with benefits paid for by businesses and invisibly transferred back to consumers through price increases. Consequently, cash users bear the brunt of higher prices without enjoying any benefits.\nDespite market saturation, the credit card business remains profitable. For instance, nowaays even Sephora issues credit cards with attractive discounts on their own beauty products. However, Sephora\u0026rsquo;s primary goal likely isn\u0026rsquo;t the interest income but rather to cultivate a loyal customer base amid intense competition, such as with Ulta Beauty.\nspeaking of repugnant kidney markets 欲知后事如何 且听下回分解: To be continued\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"/posts/competitions_consequence/","summary":"two market fokelores that have fascinated me for a while.","title":"competition consequences I"},{"content":"bridging concepts Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to appreciate the nuanced distinction between mechanism design and market design.

The opacity and underdevelopment of these official trading centers raise questions about the viability and efficiency of proposed mechanisms in a real-world context.\nFirstly, the reported estimates of market size are somewhat misleading, as the figures I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered from various sources are inconsistent. Additionally, trading platforms such as the Shanghai Data Exchange appear to be in their infancy, characterized by limited options, exorbitant prices, and oversimplified functionalities. While the Shanghai Data Exchange claims success, showcasing ostentatious case studies on its website, the reality of making a purchase involves significant friction and inconvenience. This may be due to the critical nature of the data provided (e.g., airline schedules, parking availability, or population statistics), which perhaps should not be freely traded on the market. In any case, the market is thin and fraught with friction, far from the seamless purchasing experience platforms like Amazon or Taobao offer. It is slow and congested, and frankly, there remains considerable room for improvement, which, in turn, highlights its potential for development.\nHow can one expect a block-chain enabled, two-stage price-elicitating trading mechanism to boost the market?

The course\u0026rsquo;s popularity was such that securing a spot required a bit of tricks (aka brute-force python http requests to hack the website to get a slot)👩🏻‍💻 .\nAnd it is where I learned to do regression. The course provided a hands-on introduction to regression, data analysis, and the practical application of basic statistics—a stark contrast to the theoretical focus of the required Mathematical Statistics course, where we delved into proofs without applying them to real-world data. This elective offered a gateway into the tangible world of data manipulation, starting with the textbook Applied Linear Regression by Sanford Weisberg. Regression analysis involves correlating one variable with others based on existing data, which depends on certain assumptions about the problem at hand. Our primary tasks included estimating model parameters, testing model fit, and making predictions.\nThe question start with why on earth LINEAR regressions, given the plethora of modern data analysis tools available, such as SVMs and neural networks? The answer lies in the foundational role linear methods play in the development of these advanced tools. Linear methods offer ease of testing, fitting, and interpretation—a crucial aspect for transparency. Moreover, they provide reliable solutions for numerous statistical challenges, emphasizing the quantitative, statistical perspective in empirical research— at least it\u0026rsquo;s a vital component for publication success to get your p value down.\nThe mathematical requirements of the course were not crazy, encompassing basic linear algebra, probability theory, and a touch of optimization. On the coding front, R was introduced and recommended for its specialized packages, which prove highly convenient for specific analyses. However, my preference leans towards Python for its versatility and comprehensive functionality, including integration with various APIs and tasks—capabilities not as readily available in R.\nThe latter half of the course ventured into more exciting, albeit sometimes perceived as less practical, topics such as high-dimensional methods for classification and dimension reduction. These areas, surprisingly close to machine learning principles, included an in-depth look at logistic regression and network analysis for community identification in graphs.\nThroughout the course we looked into a lot of real-world empirical data sets, ranging from professor ratings to football player statistics, provided a practical lens through which to view and analyze information—despite their unnaturally clean and organized presentation. The final project, centered around COVID data analysis, underscored the difference between theoretical understanding and the practical application of these methods.\nIn summary, the course was a comprehensive exploration of regression analysis theory, high-dimensional methods, and hands-on data analysis experience, culminating in the intense, deadline-driven completion of the final project.\n","permalink":"/posts/data_analysis1/","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s a meme that perfectly captures the essence of understanding machine learning, a realization that dawned on me after enrolling in both machine learning and statistics courses.

The trend of businesses manipulating user reviews through incentives (like, conditional free desserts) or even writing reviews on behalf of customers has been a growing concern.\nDianping, a popular consumer review platform in China, is intensifying its measures against the practice of businesses inducing positive reviews from customers. This move underscores the company\u0026rsquo;s commitment to maintaining the integrity and reliability of its review system.\nDianping\u0026rsquo;s vigilant response In response to these manipulative practices, Dianping has implemented stringent controls. Throughout 2023, the platform deployed hundreds of risk control models to detect and clean up fabricated or induced reviews. These measures also targeted the black and grey market practices of \u0026lsquo;brushing\u0026rsquo; (fraudulently boosting store ratings by creating fake orders or reviews).\nThe platform\u0026rsquo;s risk control models proactively identify violations, and it offers a transparent reporting channel for public complaints. This is supplemented by phone call verifications and on-site risk assessments to confirm misconduct.\n\u0026ldquo;Risk control model\u0026rdquo; is a curious term to coin an anti-fraudulent incentive system. Personlly, I\u0026rsquo;m a little intrigued and am really thinking of doing an internship maybe this summer to really look into the industry.\nenforcement? hmm The news featured an example of Dianping enforcing integrity, combating induced ingenuine review:\nA recent case involved a hotpot restaurant in Xi\u0026rsquo;an, which offered free drinks to customers in exchange for positive reviews. Dianping, acting on tips from netizens and its risk control system, verified the violation through multiple channels, resulting in a warning and integrity score deduction for the merchant.\nBut the effort is mostly like a drop in the bucket. Like, how high should the stake be (for the Bs) so as to offset their incentive to fake reviews? Also, complexity introduced by heterogeneity nature of modern consumer markets creates further difficulty to design the award-incentivize-punishment system.\nThough Dianping claimed to have been actively seeking out to customers for detection of incentivized reviews, me as a frequent diner in various restaurants never received one such phone call. Moreover, honestly, I\u0026rsquo;be already became fluent in writing a seemingly \u0026ldquo;positive\u0026rdquo; review to get free desserts\u0026hellip;\non designing a platform of information Dianping\u0026rsquo;s resolve is clear: the platform\u0026rsquo;s star rating system is foundational, and it\u0026rsquo;s committed to providing \u0026ldquo;real, trustworthy, and helpful\u0026rdquo; reviews. The platform adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards false reviews and related black and grey industry chains. By optimizing its mechanisms, encouraging user participation, and fostering government and corporate cooperation, Dianping aims to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of consumers and businesses alike.\nReally, \u0026ldquo;optimizing its mechanisms\u0026rdquo; seems like a void committment that literally means nothing - its execution reveals complexities often overlooked. I can\u0026rsquo;t even recall how many times I rated in return for small gifts or desserts, and that I\u0026rsquo;ve never been approached by any phone calls from Dianping inquiring about all my ingenuine comments.\nOne good thing though, is that ratings don\u0026rsquo;t completely overshadow other quality signals. Like, it impacts a business\u0026rsquo;s visibility and ranking in recommendation charts. Yet, there are other factors at play - photos and pricing also serve as critical indicators of quality. Interestingly, consumers are not oblivious to the inflation of ratings. There\u0026rsquo;s a growing trend of savvy consumers who deliberately seek out for moderately rated ones, understanding that these might offer more genuine and authentic experiences.\nI love Dianping, so while trashing it I still wanna wish it good luck. The platform stands at a crucial juncture where more decisive actions could significantly elevate its credibility. For instance, offering monetary rewards for reporting review manipulations could be a game-changer. I believe that Dianping\u0026rsquo;s people must have thought of this solution but the reason that they\u0026rsquo;re not taking too large a step is perhaps, the platform needs to take in consideration of the power and benefit for both side of the market, so as to balance the equilibrium between consumer satisfaction and business interests, which is as vital as it is fragile.\n","permalink":"/posts/dianping/","summary":"Cracking Down on Induced Positive Reviews - Dianping\u0026rsquo;s Firm Stance.","title":"stars and struggles"},{"content":"Overwhelmed by cues from ads, editor\u0026rsquo;s picks, and various nudges, I finally caved and downloaded the new Apple Music Classical app. Though it was released on March 28, 2023, its recent intensive marketing push has really put it in the spotlight.

The Apple Music Classical app is designed to support the complex data structure of classical music.\nApple support - Apple Music Classical Q\u0026amp;A\nApart from this, Schoenberg from SSpai explores a unique intricacies and compelling reasons behind Apple Music Classical\u0026rsquo;s dedicated approach. Check out his thought-provoking review: Apple Music Classical review: why classical music should be treated separately (btw it\u0026rsquo;s in Chinese).\nrecommendation: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ In the official news release, Apple offers an extensive showcase of Apple Classical\u0026rsquo;s impressive features. Boasting the world\u0026rsquo;s largest classical music catalog and a design meticulously tailored for the genre, the app exemplifies Apple\u0026rsquo;s signature minimalist elegance. Yet, I\u0026rsquo;d still like to spotlight two particular sweets:\nalbum cover and portraits🥳 Apple has refreshed artworks for both mainstream and female🥰/minority💖 composers, intriguingly noting that most were designed on Mac and iPad – a subtle nod to their ecosystem:\nApple Music Classical listeners will also enjoy exclusive brand-new artwork, including hundreds of playlist covers, as well as unique, high-resolution digital portraits for many of the world’s greatest composers. Commissioned from a diverse group of artists, each image blends historical research with color palettes and artistic references from the relevant classical period. With the majority of these new works designed on Mac and iPad\u0026hellip; (blahblahblah, hear hear)\nFor example:\n[Dmitri Shostakovich]: Spotify composer profile (left) and Apple Music Classical composer art (right). i think everybody EXCEPT for Dmitri himself would, prefer, Apple\u0026rsquo;s version.\nFor contemporary composers like Astor Piazzolla or John Cage (yep the 4'33\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; dude), they\u0026rsquo;ve chosen abstract paintings, adding a playful yet fitting visual dimension to their innovative music.\nclassical insights It\u0026rsquo;s evident that the editors have put considerable effort into crafting insightful and engaging commentary for playlists and individual pieces. For instance, their introduction to Mozart\u0026rsquo;s Flute Concerto No. 1 in G Major is a prime example of this thoughtful approach:\nMozart was in Mannheim on a concert tour in 1778 when he met Ferdinand Dejean, a \u0026ldquo;gentleman of means\u0026rdquo; and a keen amateur flutist. A request for three concertos resulte, but Mozart ultimately delivered only two. The Flute Concerto No. 1 goes well beyond Dejean\u0026rsquo;s request for a \u0026ldquo;small, easy, and short\u0026rdquo; composition, which may be part of the reason he paid Mozart only half the sum agreed for the overall commission. 👀👀👀\nThe Concerto opens brightly, with a bracing string introduction and warm punctuation from a pair of horns. The solo flute bubbles with vitality, spinning roulades requiring considerable technical agility. The slow movement is effortlessly airborne and elegant, while hinting gently at emotional complexities just below the surface. A playful sense of humor permeates the finale, the solo flute delivering a string of high-velocity runs and decorations as the music moves to an unmistakably cheerful conclusion.\n\u0026ldquo;Bubbles with vitality\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;hinting gently at emotional complexities just below the surface\u0026rdquo; - like, OMG, right?

These online rating platforms are revolutionizing the demand pattern hence revenue stream of service providers.\nBasically, ratings platforms are to provision information. Service providers, from local bistros to boutique hotels, register themselves on these platforms. Consumers then rate these services, often accompanied by comments and photos. These ratings are the lifeblood of these platforms, determining how businesses are ranked and recommended to new users searching for, say, “nearby hotpot restaurants.” Despite the lack of transparency in these algorithms, their impact is undeniably profound, especially for those ranked highest in their categories.\nPlatforms like Dianpin, with their massive user base, essentially create and strengthen thier monopoly status due to the network aggregation effect. The top-ranked businesses enjoy unparalleled visibility, almost akin to free advertising, leading to significant market power. But what lurks behind these rankings remains a mystery to the public.\nLately, the credibility of these ratings has come under scrutiny. A high score doesn’t always equate to quality, and savvy consumers have started to ‘read between the lines.’ For instance, on Dianpin, a near-perfect rating for a new restaurant often signals inauthentic reviews. The real gems are frequently found in the 3.5 to 4-star range, with a solid history record.\nThis skepticism isn’t without consequences. The general public condemns dishonest rating practices like fake reviews or incentives for positive feedback. Meanwhile, service workers feel the pressure as these ratings increasingly dictate their performance metrics.\nBut under such strained ecosystem, blame is hard to place but is keenly felt by all parties involved. Instead of pointing fingers, like placing stricter (and would possibly be useless) regulations on service providers\u0026rsquo; integrity, perhaps it’s time to revisit the underlying mechanisms of these platforms. Like, maybe we can redesign the interaction between consumers and service providers, coordinated by the platform as information provisioner, to foster a healthier, more honest environment. Especially, how the platform would manipulates (guide) and re-direct consumers\u0026rsquo; attention throughout their search process.\nIronically, today as I was having hotpot with my mom, we started looking for hotels on a rating platforms and end up complaining about how the ratings are extensively flooded, that hardly any useful information can be derived out of them.

What started as an innovative marketing strategy quickly spread across various platforms, turning from a curious novelty into an omnipresent annoyance.\neverytime one opens an app, an ad shows up filling up the whole screen. unlike the conventional way of visiting the ads by clicking, for a shake ad, one has to \u0026lsquo;shake\u0026rsquo; to be re-directed. seriously, who would do that? it\u0026rsquo;s just fraud.\nTo understand how it works fisrt we have to look deeper into the dynamics of the advertising industry. Traditional models simply assume a two-component market with sellers and buyers, where advertising slots are auctioned off to the highest bidding buyer - a straightforward transaction. However, the real industry operates on multiple layers of complexity. Social apps like XiaoHongShu began selling their prime opening ad slots to large e-commerce sites such as T-Mall or JD, who would then resell these slots, bundled with other advertising options, to third-party retailers.\nOn the surface, this model seemed beneficial. Social media platforms monetized their user base, while advertisers got a captive audience. Consumers, in theory, received ads that signaled quality and relevance. Yet, the implementation faltered. The sensitivity of these \u0026lsquo;shake-to-view\u0026rsquo; ads was set so low that even a minor movement triggered a redirect to the advertiser\u0026rsquo;s page, leading to widespread user frustration.\nA deeper look reveals a misalignment within the industry. The surge in click-through rates, a triumph for the large e-commerce platforms and promotional departments of third-party retailers, didn\u0026rsquo;t translate to actual sales, frustrating the operations teams focused on return on investment. This discrepancy arose from the compartmentalized KPIs of these departments, each operating in a silo.\nFrom a consumer standpoint, the experience deteriorated rapidly, besieged by incessant and intrusive ads. For third-party companies, the situation was doubly detrimental. They faced higher costs for less effective advertising, coupled with a decline in consumer goodwill. Anecdotal evidence even suggests that platforms bundled these ineffective ads with more impactful advertising options, forcing smaller sellers into unfavorable agreements.\nOverall, social surplus is down for lower consumer match with worse experience. This is a classic example when the model works fine but the real market gets fucked up with misaligned incentives.\n","permalink":"/posts/ok_fine_shake/","summary":"A classic example when the model works fine but the real market gets fucked up with misaligned incentives.","title":"shake ads: innovatively malfunctioning market"},{"content":"Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s new album drops on March 8th (Yep that\u0026rsquo;s International Women\u0026rsquo;s Day.

Naturally, we would want a detector as astute as Sherlock Holmes so that he can identify, for a given code input, the exactly true state of its original author, pinned down lines to lines. For example, sometimes a piece of code can be co-authored by both GPTs and assembled by the programmer himself. But in this research, we narrow down to study a binary differentiation task to detect AI-written code, out of educational content. That is to say, we focus on beginner-level, task-specific coding problems and the answer, like the preceeding two examples.\nThe code is generated by copy-and-paste prompting a GPT model, with the output being copied and pasted to submit as some homework solution. This scenario corresponds to a realistic problem faced by educators in introductory programming courses - when instructors assigned homeworks but students just copy and paste GPT\u0026rsquo;s answer.\nThe conjecture backbone of the technique is proposed in 2023 by Mitchell et al. [1], that AI-generated text exhibits local optimality in the likelihood curvature of its source model, meaning it tends to have lower probability or higher loss after perturbations. Human-written text, on the other hand, does not exhibit this property - perturbation and original text\u0026rsquo;s probability log-likelihood are more stable.\nBtw, perturbation means, randomly masking some words (tokens) and then use another GPT model to fill in the blanks. Like this:\nhow perturbation works.\nWe re-designed a tokenize-and-perturb method tailored for codes, then replicated Mitchell\u0026rsquo;s paper\u0026rsquo;s result and found that for codes, similar rules apply\nGiven any piece of code string, we can obtain its log-likelihood (loss function value) w.r.t. a language model. For an original input code string x and its perturbation, the log(p) distribution varies statistically when according to its label (human/AI).\nNow then, everything is ready and we can implement SHERLOCK. For a piece of code $\\mathbf s_0$, it is perturbed $N$ times to obtain ${\\hat {\\mathbf {s_i}}}_{i = 1}^N$, and fed into a \u0026ldquo;grading\u0026rdquo; language model to obtain its loss function probability log-likelihood $p(\\hat {\\mathbf s_i})$ - i.e. the probability of such sentence in view of the grading language model. After this manipulation, we obtain $$ \\mathbf p(\\mathbf s) = \\begin{bmatrix} p(\\mathbf s_0)\\cr p(\\mathbf {\\hat s_1})\\cr \u0026hellip;\\cr p(\\mathbf {\\hat s_N}) \\end{bmatrix} $$ This probability vector is then used for subsequent ML binary classifier training.\nWe built a small dataset ourselves - cleaning up a Kaggle dataset of codeforces competition to obtain the problems and the solutions submitted. The solutions are in c++ and labelled as human-written since the date of the dataset is prior-GPT (2019). The problems are then used to prompt 70-b llama to obtain AI-labeled codes. Eventually, our dataset consists of $M = 216$ samples for both labels respectively. And here\u0026rsquo;s the result:\nresults obtained on the test set. it\u0026rsquo;s actually pretty neat for this small test out. we also tested Mitchell\u0026rsquo;s original threshold-based classification method (blue line on the left). it turns out that a little bit machine learning boost a long way.\nFinally, the code is here, and, the main paper that we referred to:\n[1] Eric Mitchell et al. “DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Using Probability Curvature”.

Jiawei presented his latest solo paper, \u0026ldquo;Total NP Search Problems with Abundant Solutions\u0026rdquo;. Earlier that day, a casual conversation with Professor He highlighted the intrinsic value of such talks: they offer a rare glimpse into the author\u0026rsquo;s original thought process, often obscured in the structured format of academic papers.\nAs a rookie who doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know what a factoring problem is (well, actually knowing it but failed to associate the name with the math), I dare not factorize and comment on such high level work. Basically, the class TFNP is the search analog of NP with the additional guarantee that any instance has a solution (Hubácek, 2017). Problems in this class can usually be dual-ly characterized by a combinatorial principle. Jiawei\u0026rsquo;s work defined a subclass of the TFNP class - the problems with Abundant solutions (TFAP), opposed to the Lean class (also defined w.r.t. the number of solutions of the search problem). The characterization is very natural (and nontrivial, for sure). For a lot of problems in the TFAP class they have a black-box reduction to problems in Lean class, but no white-box reduction is available now and possibly there won\u0026rsquo;t be any in the future (as it will prove P$\\equiv$NP, as he has said).\nLi concluded his talk with an engaging discussion on the Necklace-Splitting problem, a topic of particular interest to the Algorithmic Game Theory community.

Because their search and purchase decisions depend on the information environment, firms have a strong incentive to influence it. This paper endogenizes the consumer’s information environment from the firm’s perspective and endogenizes the search decision from the consumer’s perspective. We consider a dynamic model where a firm sequentially persuades a consumer to purchase the product. The consumer only wishes to buy the product if it is a good match. The firm designs the information structure. Given the endogenous information environment, the consumer trades off the benefit and cost of information acquisition and decides whether to search for more information. Given the information acquisition strategy of the consumer, the firm trades off the benefit and cost of information provision and determines how much information to provide. This paper characterizes the optimal information structure under a general signal space. We find that the firm only smooths information provision over multiple periods if the consumer is optimistic about the product fit before searching for information. Moreover, if the search cost for the consumer is high, the firm designs the information such that the consumer will be certain that the product is a good match and will purchase it after observing a positive signal. If the search cost is low, the firm provides noisy information such that the consumer will be uncertain about the product fit but will still buy it after observing a positive signal.\nAlthough, one might find it more convenient to read the conlusions part for a slightly deeper understanding\nConsumers frequently search for information before making decisions. Since their search and purchase decisions depend on the information environment, firms have a strong incentive to influence it. This paper endogenizes consumers’ information environment from the firm’s perspective under a general signal space. We examine the optimal information provision strategy of a sender and the optimal information acquisition strategy of a receiver when the sender sequentially persuades a receiver to take a particular action. The sender prefers that action regardless of the unknown state, while the receiver only wishes to take that action if the state is good. In our model, the sender incurs a cost to provide information, and the receiver incurs a cost to search. The receiver trades off the cost of searching and the benefit of obtaining more accurate information to make better decisions. The sender trades off the cost of information provision and the benefit of persuading the receiver to search and then take the sender’s preferred action. We allow for gradual communication between the sender and the receiver. Consequently, the sender also makes the intertemporal trade-off of smoothing the information to reduce the persuasion cost.\nOK. So it\u0026rsquo;s pretty common a practice that people uses convex function to measure cost of provision information. But in this paper, the convexity assumption leads to the fact that, the seller (information sender) would like to \u0026ldquo;smooth\u0026rdquo; information and do the persuasion job multiple times. Also, the information receiver (buyer\u0026rsquo;s) action is assumed to be strategic, so the game cannot be characterized using a standard linear program.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not an expert in subgame perfect eq. (maybe I should take a look at it, fuck) so that I\u0026rsquo;ll omit discussing the detail of this paper. But its application part is particularly interesting to think about, and really does shed insight on application of information design:\nValue-added Branding in Luxury Goods\nA luxury goods company wants to add value to its branding. In each period, the seller (sender) can spend money on building the luxury image of her brand. An example of the spending is advertising, which has increasing marginal costs. It may be more costly for the seller to reach richer and busier customers.\nLobbying\nCompanies (sender) have a strong incentive to influence a regulator’s (receiver) policymaking. The regulator is deciding between policies A and B, which can be a high or low standard on car/food safety, a strict or relaxed policy on privacy, etc.. The company’s cost is the effort it incurs to persuade the regulator. Raising the effort level has an increasing marginal cost.\nBUT if many other companies also have valuable information, and even, have conflicting interest, it would be cumbersome.\nOnline Advertising\nI thought I\u0026rsquo;m already too familiar with online-ads-sponsor-search shits but this is pretty much something I never thought of\nConsumers (the receiver) frequently search online to learn more about the product before making a purchasing decision. The advertiser (sender) can target a consumer (showing one ad) or retarget him (showing multiple ads to the same consumer). In each period, the advertiser can bid for the advertising spot and persuade the consumer to purchase the product. She directly controls how precise the advertising content is but can only affect the winning probability indirectly through the bidding amount. In a symmetric N-bidder first-price auction with i.i.d. uniform distribution of the valuation, the bidding amount is convex in the winning probability. (OK, this is fuzzy and simple but true anyway). The overall likelihood that the consumer receives a positive signal, $\\lambda$ equals the probability that the advertiser reaches him (winning probability) multiplied by the probability that he likes the advertising content, and is thus proportional to the winning probability. So, the advertiser’s cost is also convex in the amount of persuasion. The consumer’s cost $c$ is their time. The prior belief can come from word of mouth or past experience.\nOur model can explain why advertisers most frequently retarget consumers who have added the product to the shopping cart/list. Those consumers, on average, have a high prior belief about the product. Our model predicts that advertisers will persuade these consumers in multiple periods.\n","permalink":"/posts/strategic_search/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s always a refreshing activity to start the morning with a MS paper - even better, a freshly published one right in Nov. 2023.\nDynamic Persuasion and Strategic Search Yunfei (Jesse) Yao, Management Science 22 Nov 2023\nABSTRACT\nConsumers frequently search for information before making decisions.

Honestly, the paper itself is already a masterclass of organizing contents so as to achieve high informational utility. Following what we left yesterday, here\u0026rsquo;s the rest, and some closing thoughts before the end.\nIllustrations of Suspense-Opt. Info Policies In the simplest setting where there are only two states $\\Omega = {A, B}$ (i.e. whether AGT or FRA would win in the world cup final), suspense maximizing belief martingale give rise to the followig dynamics. Say, starting from initial prior$\\mu_A = \\mu_B = 0.5$, at period $t$ the optimal belief (say, WLOG let\u0026rsquo;s consider one side of the world, $\\mu_t \\equiv \\text{Pr}(A)$), either takes a high value $\\mu_t = H_t \u0026gt; 1/2$ or low value $\\mu_t = L_t = 1 - H_t$. Stepping onto the next period, there are two possible changes to the new belief $\\mu_{t + 1}$ - with high possibility the agent observes additional confirmation - that the higher(lower) belief gets \u0026ldquo;confirmed\u0026rdquo; a little bit further, like $H_t \\to H_{t +1}$ where $H_{t + 1} \u0026gt; H_t$ and vice versa for $L_t$. Alternatively with small possibility, a plot twist happens, $H_t \\to L_{t + 1}$ and vice versa for $L_t$.\nborrowing a pic from the original paper. in the OPT. suspense martingale, towards next period, belief (circled dot) either stay and strenthen its belief with high possibility, or jump to another extreme with small possibility.\nWith three or more states, there is additional flexibility in the design of the optimal info policy (that maximize suspense). Consider A Study in Scarlet (Dole, 1887), suspects could be a bunch of people, and the author may maintain everyone\u0026rsquo;s suspicious until the end or rule out some of them during the middle. So there the alive-til-the-end policy, no clue rules out anyone\u0026rsquo;s until the last chapter. But sometimes sequential elimination can also work, where one of the probabilities is quickly taken to zero. For example, when one of the suspects got killed in the middle of the story.\nSurprise-Opt. Info Policies. While suspense-optimal policies have some clean characterization, solving for the surprise-optimal martingale is difficult in general and, in contrast to the case of suspense, sensitive to the choice of $u(·)$. Focusing one two-state setting, consider a specification where surprise in period $t$ equals $|\\mu_t - \\mu_{t - 1}|$ where once again $\\mu_t \\equiv \\text{Pr}(A)$.\nThen, by letting $W_T(\\mu)$ be the value function of the surprise maximizing problem, where $T$ is the number of periods remaining, $\\mu$ the current belief, we can express it via DP: $$ \\begin{align} W_T(\\mu) \u0026amp; = \\max_{\\tilde \\mu\u0026rsquo; \\in \\Delta(\\Delta(\\Omega))} \\mathbb E_{\\tilde \\mu\u0026rsquo;}[|\\mu\u0026rsquo; - \\mu| + W_{T-1}(\\mu\u0026rsquo;)]\\cr \u0026amp; s.t. E_{\\tilde \\mu\u0026rsquo;}[\\mu\u0026rsquo;] = \\mu\\text{ (committment constraint)} \\end{align} $$ And, some properties of the solved opt. info policy:\nThe single-period problem can always be solved by some $\\tilde \\mu\u0026rsquo;$ with binary support. Like, for any current belief, there is a surprise-maximizing martingale such that next period’s belief is either some $\\mu_l $ or $\\mu_h$.\nBut the optimal information policy accepts a positive probability of early resolution in return for a chance to move beliefs back to the interior and set the stage for later surprises. Also unlike the suspense solution, uncertainty can both increase or decrease over time. Realized surprise is stochastic, and beliefs might move early to degenerate (fully revealed), or moving back to initial belief.\nComparing Two Optimal Policies with an Analogy While no existing sport would induce the exact distributions of belief paths we derive, we can think of soccer and basketball as representing extreme examples of sports with the qualitative features of optimum suspense and surprise.\nIn any given minute of a soccer game it is very likely that nothing consequential happens. Whichever team is currently ahead becomes slightly more likely to win (since less time remains). There is a small chance that a team scores a goal, however, which would have a huge impact on beliefs. So, belief paths in soccer are smooth, with few rare jumps. This sustained small probability of large belief shifts makes soccer a very suspenseful game.\nIn basketball, points are scored every minute. With every possession, a team becomes slightly more likely to win if it scores and slightly less likely to win if it does not. But no single possession can have a very large impact on beliefs, at least not until the final minutes of the game. Belief paths are spiky, with a high frequency of small jumps up and down; basketball is a game with lots of surprise.\nConstrained Info Policies I think this is where surprise of the paper comes in - that this part, seemingly boring at first sight (that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even prepared to read it), turns out to be very interesting. Basically, there are often institutional restrictions (OK, whatever it is) which impose constraints on the information the principal can release over time. Examples include\nTournament Seeding:\nConsider the problem of designing an elimination tournament to maximize audience interest. The planner(mechanism designer?!)\u0026rsquo;s job is to properly design the buckets of groups and seed teams into respectively one of them.\nThe simplest example is that, when there are three teams and two teams play in a first round and the winner plays the remaining team in the final. This remaining team is said to have the first-round “bye.” When the teams are assymetrical, which team should have the bye?\nSequential Contests\nExample is president election - when the two parties want to winning over states. But, in what order should the states vote if the goal is to maximize the suspense or surprise of the race?\nA more exciting primary season may elicit more attention from citizens, yielding a more engaged and informed electorate. In order to highlight the relevant mechanisms, our analysis here will assume that the order of the primaries does not affect the likelihood any given candidate wins.\nWe model a primary campaign as follows. Two candidates, A and B, compete against each other in a series of winner-take-all state primary elections. State $i$ has $n_i$ delegates and will be won by candidate A with probability $p_i$. The probability A wins each state is independent. Candidate A wins the nomination if and only if she gets at least $n^\\star \\in [0, \\sum_i n_i]$ delegates.\nSo far, it seems that, since early states are sure to impose a small but positive impact on beliefs about the nominee, whereas late states have some chance of being extremely important and some chance of having zero impact. Then, to max surprise or suspense, should swing states go first or smaller or more partisan states should go first?\nAnd the paper has this cool result:\nRemarkably, for any distribution of delegates ni, for any set of probabilities $p_i$, for any cutoff $n^\\star$, the order of the primaries has no effect on expected suspense or surprise. Small or large states, partisan or swing states – they may go in any order.\nA Little Words There are some more generalizations at the end of the paper, that the author brought up and relates with, I think, one of their subsequent work on characterizing informational uncertainty. In my point of view, there are some potential for computational study to step in here. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it here, to play a little trick of suspense, and lack of closure.\n","permalink":"/posts/finally_surprise/","summary":"Finished reading the paper Suspense And Surprise finally.

The paper is already concise so basically I\u0026rsquo;m just copying it from there to here\u0026hellip; Cause I like it actually.\nThe model Consider a finite state space $\\Omega$, where a typical state of the world is $w$ (it should be $\\omega$ but let\u0026rsquo;s save a bit typing). A typical belief is denoted by a probability vector $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)$; $\\mu^w$ designates the probability of $w$. Let $t \\in {0, 1, \u0026hellip;, T}$ denote the period. Let\u0026rsquo;s say, the prior is $\\mu_0$.\nAn information policy $\\tilde \\pi$ is a mapping of some belief $\\mu$ and current period $t$ to the distribution space $\\Delta(S)$ of signals. A belief martingale $\\tilde \\mu$ is a sequence $(\\mu_t)_{t = 0}^T$ s.t.\n$\\tilde \\mu_t \\in \\Delta(\\Delta(\\Omega))$ for all $t$, with $\\tilde \\mu_0$ degenerate at $\\mu_0$, and $\\mathbb E[\\tilde \\mu_t | \\mu_0, \u0026hellip;, \\mu_{t - 1}] = \\mu_{t - 1}$. A realization of the belief martingale is a belief path $\\eta = (\\mu_t)_{t = 0}^T$. Given an information policy $\\tilde \\pi$ and a prior $\\mu_0$ to start from, they generates a stochastic path of beliefs about the state - we denote this induced belief martingale as $\\lang \\tilde \\pi | \\mu_0\\rang$. Lemma 1 Given any Markov belief martingale $\\tilde \\mu$, there exists an information policy $\\tilde \\pi$ that induces it, i.e. $\\tilde \\mu = \\lang \\tilde \\pi | \\mu_0\\rang$.\nNotably, condition (iii) guarantees that the martingale is Bayesian-persuasible. A Markov belief martigale satisfy that $\\tilde \\mu_{t + 1}$ depends only on $\\mu_t$. For the problem studied in the paper, it suffices to consider Markov cases, quote\nThe assumption that $\\tilde \\pi$ depends only on the current belief and period, and thus induces a Markov martingale, is without loss of generality in the sense that memoryless policies do not restrict the set of feasible payoffs. If payoffs were not time-separable, it might be beneficial to employ history-dependent information policies which could induce non-Markov martingales.\nThere are two players: the agent and the principal. The agent has utility (it\u0026rsquo;s framed as \u0026ldquo;preference\u0026rdquo; in the paper originallly. Hmmm, econ considerations.) of the belief path and belief martingale: $$ \\begin{align} U_{\\text{suspense}}(\\eta, \\tilde \\mu) \u0026amp; = \\sum_{t = 0}^{T - 1} u(\\mathbb E|\\tilde \\mu_{t + 1} - \\mu_t|^2_2)\\cr U_{\\text{surprise}}(\\eta) \u0026amp; = \\sum_{t = 1}^Tu(| \\mu_{t + 1} - \\mu_t|^2_2 \\end{align} $$ where $u(\\cdot)$ here is assumed to be some increasing, strictly concave function with $u(0) = 0$, the square-norm $|\\cdot|_2^2$ can be generalized into weighted versions, and so does weights on time $t$. So, suspense is induced by conditional variance (on current belief $\\mu_t$) over the next period\u0026rsquo;s beliefs, and surprise is just a measure of the trajectory of realized believes.\nThe paper included some examples. Especially, the Blackjack simulation is comprehensive. But, a cooler example (that they used, yet didn\u0026rsquo;t fully exploit, in my pov) would be football (well, soccer if you\u0026rsquo;d prefer). Football data has been very helpful to economics. A book called Beautiful Game Theory: How Soccer Can Help Economics has used the world\u0026rsquo;s most popular sport to test economic theories and document novel human behavior. Basically, it modelled penalty as a zero-sum game with a 2-by-2 reward matrix, and validified randomized strategy of Nash Eq. doing econometric analysis.\nThe principal\u0026rsquo;s problem (part I) The principal seeks to maximize either suspense, or surprise $$ \\begin{align} \\max_{\\tilde \\pi} \u0026amp; \\ \\mathbb E_{\\eta \\sim \\lang \\tilde \\pi |\\mu_0\\rang}U_{\\text{suspense}}(\\eta, \\lang \\tilde \\pi |\\mu_0\\rang)\\cr \\max_{\\tilde \\pi}\u0026amp; \\ \\mathbb E_{\\eta \\sim \\lang \\tilde \\pi |\\mu_0\\rang}U_{\\text{surprise}}(\\eta) \\end{align} $$ Btw, beacuse Lemma 1 allows us to associate any belief martigale with an info-policy that induces it, we can focus on optimizing over possible martigales, instead of information policy $\\tilde \\pi$ in the optimization, i.e. $$ \\begin{align} \\max_{\\tilde \\pi}\u0026amp; \\ \\mathbb E_{\\eta \\sim \\tilde \\mu}U_{\\text{suspense}}(\\eta,\\tilde \\mu)\\cr \\max_{\\tilde \\pi} \u0026amp; \\ \\mathbb E_{\\eta \\sim \\tilde \\mu}U_{\\text{surprise}}(\\eta) \\end{align} $$ For maximizing suspense, the result is pretty neat and beautiful. First of all, say, denote each period $t$\u0026rsquo;s suspense (conditional on $\\mu_t$ revealed) be $\\sigma_t^2 = \\mathbb E_{{\\mu_{t + 1} \\sim \\tilde \\mu_{t + 1} |\\mu_t}} |\\mu_{t+1} - \\mu_t|^2$, the principal\u0026rsquo;s problem is then, choosing a belief martigale $\\tilde \\mu$ (and its corresponding info-policy $\\tilde \\pi$ to maximize $ \\mathbb E_{\\tilde \\mu}\\sum_{t = 0}^{T-1}u(\\sigma_t^2)$.\nLemma 2 Any suspense-maximizing info-policy is fully-revealing by the end. For any info-policy that is fully-revealing by the end, $$ \\mathbb E_{\\tilde \\mu}\\sum_{t = 0}^{T-1}\\sigma_t^2 = \\Phi(\\mu_0) $$ which is independent of $\\tilde \\mu$, hence, $\\tilde \\pi$, the info-policy chosen.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s equivalent to consider the problem like, starting from a prior $\\mu_0$, the principal is endowed with a \u0026ldquo;budget of variance\u0026rdquo; $\\Phi(\\mu_0)$ which only depends on $\\mu_0$. The problem is then to decide how to allocate variance across each period to maximize utility. And it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to guess that, given $u$ being concave, it would be optimal to allocate variance evenly across all periods, like, keep the tension up from start to end. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s the truth as well\nProp. 1 A belief martingale maximizes expected suspense iff. $\\mu_t \\in M_t$ for all $t$, where $$ M_t \\equiv {\\mu|\\Phi(\\mu) = \\frac{T - t} T\\Phi(\\mu_0)}. $$ The agent\u0026rsquo;s expected suspense from the corresponding opt. policy is $Tu(\\Phi(\\mu_0)/T)$.\nIn other words, suspense is constant over time with uncertainty declines gradually.\nGoodnight. tmrw features principal\u0026rsquo;s problem part II, along with rest of the paper read.\n","permalink":"/posts/model_sns/","summary":"the model, and the principal\u0026rsquo;s problem part I","title":"a study in suspense and surprise - part I"},{"content":"Listening to demos and unreleased tracks is like reading an artist\u0026rsquo;s diary.

Well, sometimes, the academic stars just align!\nSuspense and Surprise By Jeffrey Ely, Alexander Framkel and Emir Kamenica\nABSTRACT\nWe model demand for noninstrumental information, drawing on the idea that people derive entertainment utility from suspense and surprise. A period has more suspense if the variance of the next period’s beliefs is greater. A period has more surprise if the current belief is further from the last period’s belief. Under these definitions, we analyze the optimal way to reveal information over time so as to maximize expected suspense or surprise experienced by a Bayesian audience. We apply our results to the design of mystery novels, political primaries, casinos, game shows, auctions, and sports.\nI recognize some-thing when I see one.

What\u0026rsquo;s funny is that, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even remember how it landed in my reading list cause well, my cortex has been a bit messy recently. Anyway, what a beautiful bump.\nABSTRACT\nAttention costs can cause some information to be ignored and decisions to be imperfect. Can we improve the material welfare of a rationally inattentive agent by restricting his information in the first place? In our model, a well-intentioned principal provides information to an agent for whom information is costly to process, but the principal does not internalize this cost. We show that full information is universally optimal if and only if the environment comprises one issue. With multiple issues, attention management becomes optimal: the principal restricts some information to induce the agent to pay attention to other aspects.\nThe paper\u0026rsquo;s model is similar to Bayesian Persuasion (Kamenica 2011) but with the utility function aligned between the principle and the agent (so it\u0026rsquo;s kinda easier in this sense, that there\u0026rsquo;s no \u0026ldquo;persuasion\u0026rdquo; happening). The problem arises when we consider the agent has an attention cost defined as a mapping $C: \\mathcal R(\\mu) \\to \\mathbb R_+$, where $\\mu\\in \\Delta \\Theta$ is a typical prior ($\\Theta$ is world state space and $\\Delta \\Theta$ refers to set of distribution over $\\Theta$), $\\mathcal R(\\mu)$ is the set of information policies\u0026rsquo; outcome, like, given a signal $\\mu$ and the set of all possible (distribution of) posterior as the outome of some information policy is: $$ \\mathcal R(\\mu) := { p\\in \\Delta \\Delta \\Theta:\\int_{\\Delta \\Theta}\\nu \\ dp(\\nu) = \\mu} $$ and $C$ should be convex and continuous. Eventually, the problem of the principle becomes $$ \\begin{align} \\sup_{p,q }\\ \u0026amp; \\int_{\\Delta \\Theta} U_p\\ dq\\cr s.t.\\ \u0026amp; p\\in \\mathcal R(\\mu)\\cr \u0026amp; q\\in G^\\star(p)\\cr \\end{align} $$ where $U$ is just utility (take expectation over distribution $p$) and $G^\\star(p)$ referes to the agent with attention cost\u0026rsquo;s optimal response ($q$ is the information that the agent pay attention to when $p$ is the information sent by the principle). Mathematically $$ G^\\star(p) := \\arg\\max_{q\\in \\mathcal R(\\mu):q\\preceq^B p} {\\int_{\\Delta\\Theta} U \\ dq - C(q)} $$ (btw, $q\\preceq^B p$ means that $p$ is more (Blackwell) informative than $q$, kinda like its mean-preserving spread or something).\nResult:\nFull info disclosure is optimal iff. the state is binary. Withholding information can be optimal, helping guide the agent to make better decisions when there are more (≥3) states. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time (or energy) today to thoroughly go through the math. But I think this model is very insightful (well, it\u0026rsquo;s in AER afterall\u0026hellip;) and has potential to shed light on theoretical as well as behavioral econ.

According to Wikipedia, or just watch it on YouTube:\nThe music video premiered on Bieber\u0026rsquo;s YouTube channel the same day of the song. Filming took place at Alexandria house and California state University, Northridge\u0026rsquo;s Oviatt Library. Directed by Michael D. Ratner,[41] the video previews Bieber (along with Quavo) drawing attention to the difficulties of women and children in need while raising awareness and funds for Alexandria House, whose mission is to help them move from crisis to stability.[42]\nSpeaking on the background of the music video, Bieber stated that he wanted to shine a light on social issues that are happening in the world that people are often overlooking and that he wanted to make people aware of the hurting and broken people that are suffering in humanity.[43] He then posted a short version of the music video, only the parts with the song playing, on February 12, 2020. As of January 14, 2021, the video has crossed 291 million views on the platform.[44]\nThis trend of thematic divergence in music videos isn\u0026rsquo;t isolated to Bieber.

Dumplings, once a symbol of warmth and comfort during the deep winter, now seem increasingly commercialized and expensive, particularly in chain stores and food delivery services. This shift reflects less of the cherished tradition and more of a capital-driven venture, stripping away the essence of what made these foods special.\nAn explanation I came across sheds light on this transformation:\nAs young people in first-tier cities lament over soaring dumpling prices, a significant factor is the exorbitant operational costs, primarily driven by high rental fees. Consequently, dining out often equates to indirectly \u0026lsquo;paying the rent\u0026rsquo;.\nBut besides this aspects, there is something more.\nThe heart of the issue lies in the capital-driven nature of modern food businesses. In a landscape dominated by commercial models, the primary impulse for owners is revenue maximization. This goal manifests in two key strategies: reducing production costs, often leading to diminished food quantities, and inflating prices per consumer. The objective is to steadily build a business that can report substantial net income within a few years, paving the way for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This process culminates in a financial windfall for investors, who typically cash out their stakes post-IPO, leaving the essence of the food – in this case, dumplings – as a mere commodity in the broader economic game. This shift from tradition to transaction marks a profound change in how we experience these cultural staples, turning what was once a symbol of warmth and community into another line item on a balance sheet.\nNot a good news for me. So at least, I just ate hand-made dumplines at my school\u0026rsquo;s dining hall.\nwith my friend we ate at the dining hall. despite there was a long queue and, i gotta say, the dumplings are nice and the atmosphere was so lovely. we sat at a window seat, under the sun, spending time with great food and friend.\n","permalink":"/posts/dumplings/","summary":"On December 22nd during DongZhi, there is the tradition of eating dumplings.

It was a precious opportunity to look into the lab structure of my neighboring department as well as learn from the work ethic of my peers. The conclusion is - I gotta work harder\u0026hellip;\nAt the end of the talk, Professor Ye mentioned a paper of his about online LP. Here it is: I managed to read through some of its contents, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool.\nConsider an LP in the following format: $$ \\begin{align} \\max \\ \u0026amp; \\sum_{t = 1}^n \\pi_t x_t\\cr s.t. \\ \u0026amp;\\sum_{t = 1}^n a_{it} x_t \\le b_i, i = 1, \u0026hellip;, m\\cr \u0026amp; 0\\le x_t\\le 1, \\forall t = 1, \u0026hellip;, n\\cr \\end{align} $$ We simplify by considering that, for all $j$, $\\mathbf {a_j} \\in [0, 1]^m$, $\\pi_j \\ge 0$. In an online setting, at each time $t = 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, n$, the coefficients $(\\pi_t, \\mathbf a_t)$ are revealed, and then $x_t$ has to be chosen (and it needs to be feasible, i.e., $\\sum_{j = 1}^t a_{ij} x_j \\le b_i\\ \\forall i, t$). For online analysis, it is further assumed that ${\\mathbf a_{i}}_{i = 1, \u0026hellip;, m}$ can be picked adversarially, but the arrival order of them is uniformly distributed over all permutations.\nAnd the paper considered the competitiveness of the online algorithm. Let $OPT$ denote the optimal objective value for the preceding problem solved offline. We say an algorithm is $c$-competitive in the random permutation model if the expected value of the online solution obtained by using the algorithm is at least a $c$ factor of $OPT$, i.e., $$ \\mathbb E_\\sigma [\\sum_{t = 1}^n \\pi_t \\tilde x_t]\\ge c\\cdot OPT $$ And the model (and result!) can be generalized to when $x$ arrives in batches. Specific applications of this problem include online knapsack/secretary problem, online routing problem (in networks, for example), and online adwords problem (hmm, the smell of money). Actually, I do think live-donor kidney exchanges are a sort of online matching and can be generalized to this form, though it would lose a bit of efficiency as we structure the problem in a different context. But anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s a cool paper to start with if one (well, me) has completely no idea about online algorithms\u0026hellip;\nThe key idea of the algorithm is that, for $n$ large, we may take some threshold $s = \\epsilon n$ and learn the (sub-optimal) dual variables $p^s$ of the revealed problem so far, and use them as (approximately good) thresholds to pick the outcomes. To be more specific, at time $s = \\epsilon n$, we solve the partial linear program defined only for inputs until now: $$ \\begin{align} \\max \\ \u0026amp; \\sum_{t = 1}^s \\pi_t x_t\\cr s.t. \\ \u0026amp;\\sum_{t = 1}^s a_{it} x_t \\le (1 - \\epsilon) \\epsilon \\cdot b_i, i = 1, \u0026hellip;, m\\cr \u0026amp; 0\\le x_t\\le 1, \\forall t = 1, \u0026hellip;, s\\cr \\end{align} $$ and use its dual variable $p^s$ to decide, for the upcoming $x_{t+1}$ with $(\\pi_{t + 1}, \\mathbf a_{t + 1})$, its allocation: $$ x_{t + 1}(p^s) = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; \\text{if } \\pi_{t+1} \\le (p^s)^T a_t\\cr 1 \u0026amp; \\text{if } \\pi_{t+1} \u0026gt; (p^s)^T a_t \\end{cases} $$ To achieve the result of $c = 1 - O(\\epsilon)$ or, more specifically, $1 - O(\\sqrt{m \\log n / B})$, a dynamic, adaptive approach is needed. This involves periodically solving for $p^s$ to adjust the dual variable threshold adaptively.\nThe proof idea is roughly that, if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky enough to obtain $p^s = p^{\\star}$ during the online process, where $p^\\star$ is the optimal dual variable, our approximate solution would be close to optimal and we\u0026rsquo;re done. In reality, our algorithm uses an online-solved $p^s$ as a substitute, but it is a good proxy for $p^\\star$ – meaning that with high probability its solution is feasible and the expected value of the objective is close to $OPT$.\nBtw, I have to say, the paper-reading technique really works. It\u0026rsquo;s such a joy reading this paper (or, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because its math and results are beautiful in the first place). Anyway, stay tuned. I will go through and write about the proof as an exercise later.

But looking back at 2023, there was plenty on the health beat to be awed by.\nA new generation of drugs that result in significant weight loss. COVID is finally over. Xenotransplant is on the way. FDA approved the first CRISPR-based treatment for sickle cell disease. Another transplant story: doctors in New York City completed the first partial face and whole-eye transplant Particularly, a deep dive into the XENOTRANSPLANTS:\nMore than 100,000 people in the U.S. are currently on waiting lists for an organ transplant, the vast majority of them [for kidneys](https://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-donation-and-transplant/transplant-waiting-list#:~:text=The list is managed by,%) waiting for a kidney.). Every day 17 people die waiting for a transplant. The procurement system uses only a small fraction of the available organs at any particular time because of logistical and medical hurdles and a controversial distribution system. Transplants remain out of reach for too many people, especially those of color and with low incomes; many never even get put on a waiting list.\nRecent medical advances in treating infections such as hepatitis C and HIV have made previously unusable organs usable. In addition, technology has made it possible to keep organs viable for longer outside a body before a transplant and even to improve their quality. Yet the demand for organs still far outstrips the supply.\nAnd an intriguing perspective shared by Montgomery, an abdominal transplant surgeon, on the status quo of the current organ transplant system:\nMontgomery compares the current, inadequate organ transplant system to an economy running on fossil fuels. “You can have it burn cleaner, you can make all these various changes,” he says, “but it\u0026rsquo;s still never going to be what you really need, which is something that\u0026rsquo;s renewable, that is sustainable.” Xenotransplants, for Montgomery, are renewable energy.\nFrom an existentialist standpoint, this comparison is apt. However, until xenotransplantation becomes universally safe and implementable, we remain in the process of building a more effective system. The love, loss, and anguish behind each medical story resonate deeply, and each successful transplant signifies a world of difference for many.\n","permalink":"/posts/health2023/","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s Scientific America\u0026rsquo;s The Biggest Health and Medicine Stories of 2023 by TANYA LEWIS.

There is also growing need to understand the lexical, syntactic and stylistic features of AIGC. To address these challenges in English language teaching, we first present ArguGPT, a balanced corpus of 4,038 argumentative essays generated by 7 GPT models in response to essay prompts from three sources: (1) in-class or homework exercises, (2) TOEFL and (3) GRE writing tasks. Machine-generated texts are paired with roughly equal number of human-written essays with three score levels matched in essay prompts. We then hire English instructors to distinguish machine essays from human ones. Results show that when first exposed to machine-generated essays, the instructors only have an accuracy of 61% in detecting them. But the number rises to 67% after one round of minimal self-training. Next, we perform linguistic analyses of these essays, which show that machines produce sentences with more complex syntactic structures while human essays tend to be lexically more complex. Finally, we test existing AIGC detectors and build our own detectors using SVMs and RoBERTa. Results suggest that a RoBERTa fine-tuned with the training set of ArguGPT achieves above 90% accuracy in both essay- and sentence-level classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of argumentative essays produced by generative large language models. Machine-authored essays in ArguGPT and our models will be made publicly available at this https URL\nSo, ArguGPT is an AI designed to discriminate whether essays, particularly argumentative ones, and responses to GRE and TOEFL writing tasks, are penned by humans or GPTs. Its author team diverses among machine learning experts as well as profs. and students from the School of Foreign Language, SJTU. Hence using some student essay corpus would be quite handy a choice.\nFrom an undergraduate perspective, I find the ArguGPT tool they developed somewhat interesting. The authors have generously open-sourced their software and even established an online platform on HuggingFace for public experimentation. So, I tested it with some GPT-generated content from my collection, including my application essay:\n(take a look, and at the end we\u0026rsquo;ll unveil how much it\u0026rsquo;s GPT-generated)\nMy proceeding work involves redesigning Amazon’s Buy-Box. The Buy-Box of each merchandise highlights one seller by imposing a search friction on all others. Current design of the Buy-Box yields a non-stable market dynamic reflecting wild fluctuation in prices. We proved the non-existence of any pure Nash Equilibrium in the current system and developed another optimal mechanism that stabilizes market outcomes, maximizes social welfare and benefits all market participants.\nThis research and my academic pursuits are rooted in the interdisciplinary of market design and algorithmic game theory (AGT). I aspire to leverage the power and beauty of mathematics to economic theory, applications ranges from design of online advertising auctions to organ donation systems. This ambition has been underpinned by solid mathematical training over the past few years.\nMoreover, I believe that game theorists need to be sensitive to cultural and psychological factors to understand the incentives and constraints that people face.

It is easy to show that there are picking sequences that give every agent (that uses the greedy picking strategy) a bundle of chores of disvalue at most twice her share value (maximin share, MMS, for agents of equal entitlement, and anyprice share, APS, for agents of arbitrary entitlement). Aziz, Li and Wu (2022) designed picking sequences that improve this ratio to 5/3 for the case of equal entitlement. We design picking sequences that improve the ratio to 1.733 for the case of arbitrary entitlement, and to 8/5 for the case of equal entitlement. (In fact, computer assisted analysis suggests that the ratio is smaller than 1.543 in the equal entitlement case.) We also prove a lower bound of 3/2 on the obtainable ratio when n is sufficiently large.\nOur results trivially imply that (for additive valuation over chores) in the arbitrary entitlement case, there always is an allocation that gives every agent at most 1.733APS, and in the equal entitlement case, there always is a distribution over allocations that gives every agent at most 1.6MMS ex-post, and at most the proportional share ex-ante. Neither of these implications were previously known to hold.\nAdditional contributions of our work include improved guarantees in the equal entitlement case when n is small; introduction of the chore share as a convenient proxy to other share notions for chores; introduction of ex-ante notions of envy for risk averse agents, and enhancements to our picking sequences that eliminate such envy.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard people joking about fair division, that there\u0026rsquo;re just a bag of words - \u0026ldquo;divisible\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;envy-freeness\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;max-min share\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;additive utility\u0026rdquo; etc etc. You just randomly draw some reasonable combination of these configurations and there\u0026rsquo;ll be a paper. That was fun. Though, I genuinely found today\u0026rsquo;s paper is really interesting and, to be honest, the lecturer conveyed his ideas in a pretty neat and concise way. He even started to draw on whiteboards so as to explain some matters - it requires some courage to dive into details during TCS talks.\nThere is a notion of \u0026ldquo;responsibility\u0026rdquo; (in terms of division of chores), or \u0026ldquo;entitlement\u0026rdquo; (in terms of division of goods), where agents with higher responsibility are expected to take upon themselves more of the chores, and they\u0026rsquo;re used interchangeably. We have the entitlement vector $\\mathbf b\\in \\R_+^n, \\sum_i b_i = 1$ for the $n$ agents.\nThe focus of our work will be a special class of allocation mechanisms, referred to as picking sequences. To design a picking sequence for an allocation instance with a set of $n$ agents and a set $m$ items, one only needs to know the entitlement vector $\\mathbf b$ but not the cardinal informations - valuations $v_i$ for them.\nPicking sequence is essentially a vector $\\mathbf \\pi = (\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \u0026hellip;, \\pi_m)\\in \\Pi^m$, where $\\Pi$ is the set of identifier for pickers. This allocation mechanism is straightforward that, in the main stage (after picking sequence $\\pi$ is given), each agents $\\pi_k$ just pick what\u0026rsquo;s left. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to execute, straightforward to understand and even better, agents doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to report their valuation at this stage.\nBut, though picking sequences are attractive allocation mechanisms, they are not optimal in terms of the guarantees that they offer. For example, there exists instance, under Eating Mechanism [Bogomolnaia and Moulin 2001], agents\u0026rsquo; utility stochastically dominates use of random order picking sequences.\nHuang\u0026rsquo;s paper considered two benchmarks: max-min share (MMS) [Budish 2011] and anyprice share (APS) [Babaioff et al. 2021]. MMS applies to settings when agents have equal entitlement, where APS is a more generalized fairness notion that can be evaluated when agents have heterogeneous entitlement. The paper also introduced another notion of share - chore share. It is applicable only for additive disvaluation functions over chores, and serves as a convenient lower bound for the APS.\nThe algorithm and proof is long, filling a single linespace 30-page paper, hence I plan not to copy it here\u0026hellip; But in general, Huang broke down their ideas in a brilliantly concise manner, so that here\u0026rsquo;s the key takeaway. They proved that there exists a picking sequence for $n$ agents and arbitrary entitlement $\\mathbf b$, where the agents uses the greedy picking strategy, that yields ratio 1.733. The proof is done by, starting from proportional allocation (of chores), refine is towards some good fractional allocation and finally round it towards integral.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand completely if the ridge sequence of picking order can be calculated efficiently or only existence is guaranteed. But let\u0026rsquo;s mark it here, and maybe in the future we\u0026rsquo;ll have the opportunity that takes inspire from this problem.\ncoolness, i actually liked it, despite fair division really sounds like some cliché idea\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"/posts/fair_division_hx/","summary":"The talk was on fireeeee.

Pretty cool right? Moreover, let $$ u^{KL}(a, w) = -\\log a^w $$ It can be verified that this utility function forms a decision problem corresponds to a \u0026ldquo;proper scoring rule\u0026rdquo; for eliciting truthful beliefs, and actually, powers the above measure of information and uncertainty. Although the decision problem that a couple of measure of information/uncertainty is not unique, there is a direct way of constructing some utility function right from the measure.\nBuying Information Consider the mechanism design problem, we wanna compensate a observer of information to revel his information.\nLet the prior be $q$. There are two periods $t\\in {1, 2}$ and two available signals $\\pi_\\alpha^$ (arrives at period $1$), $\\pi_\\beta^$ (arrives at period $2$). The observer will reveal information in the first and second stage, each time after (optionally and perhaps strategically) observing the signal, and that he would reveal all information at the second stage. The observer is compensated by some payment function both in the first and second stage, based on the information he reveals, but he might delay revelation of information and perhaps misreport.\nThere are two kinds of stratigics. First, the seller can delay the arrival of information, choosing to observe $\\pi_\\alpha$ instead of $\\pi_\\alpha^$, restricted to such that $q(\\alpha^)$ is a mean-preserving spread of $q(\\alpha)$ - that $\\pi_\\alpha$ is less informative than the original signal $\\pi_\\alpha^*$. Second, he can delay the revelation of signal, i.e. on receiving $\\alpha$, he might reveal $\\alpha$ (truthfully) or nothing.\nLet the payment of the first stage and second stage be $t(p1, q)$ and $t(p2, p1)$, where $p_1 = q(\\alpha)$ and $p2 = q(\\alpha \\cap \\beta)$ - the updated distribution.\nIncentive Compatibility We define two notions of incentive compatibility:\nPayment $t$ is ex ante incentive compatible, if seller don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;delay the arrival of information\u0026rdquo; - hence always choose to observe signal $\\alpha^*$ in the first stage. Payment $t$ is interim incentive compatible, if for every $q$ and possible signals $\\pi_\\alpha, \\pi_\\beta$, the seller always prefer to reveal $\\alpha$ (other than nothing) in period $1$. If both IC conditions are satisfied, we say that $t$ is incentive compatible.\n[Lemma] ex ante incentive compatible =\u0026gt; interim incentive compatible.\nQuote the paper remarking on this lemma\nAt first glance, it might seem that interim incentive compatibility is more difficult to satisfy than ex ante incentive compatibility since the seller can condition the decision of whether to delay on the first period’s signal realization. This turns out not to be the case; in fact, ex ante incentive compatibility is the stronger condition.\nThanks to the lemma, we then only need to focus on ex ante IC. And right after this we have\n[Theorem] A payment function is incentive compatible if and only if it is a valid measure of information.\nThe idea behind this theorem is that if a payment function satisfies Order-invariance, then delaying any signal (at the ex ante or interim stage) has zero impact on the expected payment.\nCoolness.\n","permalink":"/posts/measuring_information_and_uncertainty2/","summary":"buckle up for deep revelation","title":"measuring information and uncertainty"},{"content":"Following yesterday\u0026rsquo;s post about measuing information and uncertainty, reference Frankel and Kamenica (2019) AER paper.\nDefinitions Decision Problem A decision problem $\\mathcal D = (A, u)$ is defined as, an action set $A$ and a utility function $u: A\\times \\Omega\\to \\R\\cup {-\\infty}$. Assume that there exists some action $a$ such that $u(a, \\omega)$ is finite for every $\\omega$. Assume that the decision problem is well-defined, by letting $\\arg\\max_{a\\in A} E_q[u(a, \\omega)]$ be nonempty for all beliefs $q$.\nValue/Cost of Information/Uncertainty The value of information is defined as $\\nu_\\mathcal D: \\Delta(\\Omega)\\times \\Delta(\\Omega) \\to \\R$, given by $$ \\nu_\\mathcal D(p, q) = E_p[u(a^(p), w)] - E_p[u(a^(q), w)] $$ where $a^*(q) \\in \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} E_q[u(a, w)]$.\nThe cost of uncertainty is defined as $\\mathcal C_\\mathcal D:\\Delta(\\Omega)\\to \\R$, given by $$ \\mathcal C_\\mathcal D = E_q[\\max_au(a, w)] - \\max_a E_q [u(a, w)] $$\nDefining Validity A measure of information $d$ is valid iff.\n(Null-information) $d(q, q) = 0, \\forall q$.\n(Positivity) $d(p, q)\\ge 0,\\forall (p, q)$.\n(Order-invariance) Given any prior and pair of signals, the expected sum of information generated by them is indepdent of the order of their observation, i.e. $$ E[d(q(\\alpha), q) + d(q(\\alpha\\cap \\beta), q(\\alpha))] = E[d(q(\\beta), q) + d(q(\\alpha\\cap \\beta), q(\\beta))] $$\nA measure of uncertainty $H$ is valid iff.\n(Null-uncertainty) $H(\\delta_w) = 0$ for all $w$. (Concavity) $H$ is concave. Notice that these two properties jointly imply that $H$ is positive everywhere, and concavity implies that observing any signal necessarily reduces uncertainty, i.e. $\\forall q$ and $\\pi_s$, $E[H(q(s))] \\le H(q)$.\nNotice that in the above, we consider ex post value/cost of information/uncertainty - $d$ and $H$ are calculated w.r.t. realized value of signal and then take expectation.\nJointly Valid vs. Coupled Jointly Valid\n$d$ and $H$ are called jointly valid if they are defined on the same decision problem $\\mathcal D$.\nThey are coupled if, for every prior $q$ and signal $\\pi_s$, we have $$ E[d(q(s), q)] = E[H(q) - H(q(s))]. $$ In other words, for the signal $\\pi_s$, the expected amount of information generated equals the reduction in uncertainty measured.\nConsistency Because $H$ is concave, we have $H(q) + \\nabla H(q) \\cdot(p -q)\\ge H(p)$. A Bregman divergence of it be, some function mapping from $(p, q)$ to real numbers which equal to $$ g(p, q) = H(q) - H(p) + \\nabla H(q)\\cdot (p -q) $$ [Theorem] Given a valid measure of information $d$ and a valid measure of uncertainty $H$, these following conditions are equivalent to each other\n$d$ and $H$ are jointly valid. $d$ and $H$ are coupled. $H(q) = \\sum_{w\\in \\Omega} q^w d(\\delta_w, q)$ $d$ is a Bregman divergence of $H$. Checking for Validity It\u0026rsquo;s easy to check the validity of a given measure of uncertainty (positivity, null-info and concavity). But checking the validity of some measure of information seems not so straightforward, especially its order-invariance condition.\nBut first, notice that, if a measure of information if smooth, order-invariance can be confirmed by inspecting its derivatives:\n[Proposition 1] For $d$ - a measure of information - be twice differentiable in $p$ for all $q$ and satisfies Null-info. Then, $d$ satisfies Order-invariance iff. $\\partial^2 d(p, q) / \\partial p^2$ is independent of $q$.\nAnd, we have an even cooloer proposition for general $d$:\n[Proposition 2] For $d$ - a measure of information - satisfies Null-info and Positivity, it is Order-invariance iff. $d$ is a Bregman divergence of $\\sum_{w\\in \\Omega} q^w d(\\delta_w, q)$.\nInvalidity of Metrics A Bergman divergence cannot be a metric, cause if it\u0026rsquo;s a metric $$ g(p, q) + g(q, t) \\ge g(p, t) $$ which implies $$ H(q) - H(p) + H(t) - H(q) + \\nabla H\\cdot (q) (p - q) + \\nabla H(t) \\cdot (q - t)\\ge H(t) - H(p) + \\nabla H(t) (p - t) $$ and further implies $\\nabla H(q) \u0026lt;= \\nabla H(t)$ If this measure is nontrivial, that sometimes the inequality holds strictly, then it yields a contradiction.\n[Corollary] If a measure of information is a metric on $\\Delta (\\Omega)$, it does not satisfy Order-invariance and thus cannot be valid.\nFor example, as noted by Augenblick and Rabin (2018), no measure of uncertainty that can be coupled with Euclidean distance.\n","permalink":"/posts/measuring_information_and_uncertainty1/","summary":"Diving deeper.","title":"measuring information and uncertainty"},{"content":"The paper by Alexander Frankel and Emir Kamenica, featured in the American Economic Review in 2019, is exceptionally remarkable.

One need not actually find an example of an economist counseling advisees to skip that additional course in game theory and take up cultural anthropology to arrive at the sense that matters had taken a surprising turn: only a decade before one regularly encountered brash claims that all social science worth its salt must be reducible to game theory, with market design cited as evidence for why this must be so (e.g., Binmore, 2004).\nIt took me a minute to really understand what he is saying - this subtly, yet surprisingly grumpy take on game theory, that it\u0026rsquo;s insufficient for fully understanding markets\u0026rsquo; design, hence the need for cultural anthropology, history studying and more \u0026ldquo;social science\u0026rdquo; aspect to step in.\nReally? It\u0026rsquo;s true that market designers, who mostly come from an interdisciplinary background of CS and mathematics, sometimes are incautious in selecting economic models for their work, and just dive in math too quickly. However, I do think that the issues in malfunctioning markets stem from economic models failing to accurately represent all incentives, rather than a fundamental shortcoming in game theory methodologies itself. The solution will never be to discard the mathematical framework game theory introduced, but to enhance our understanding of these issues from an economist\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nIndeed, game theorists need to be sensitive to cultural and psychological things precisely to better understand the incentives and constraints that people face. Yet reading Nik-Khah\u0026rsquo;s paper, I found his point of view biased and the paper itself it\u0026rsquo;s hard to understand from the first place. In terms of style, it\u0026rsquo;s very distinct from works of the econ-CS community, which natually make sense cause Nik-Khah stems from a econ-history background.

Saif Benjaafar, based on his MSOM review paper Operations Management in the Age of the Sharing Economy: What Is Old and What Is New?. The paper described three \u0026ldquo;canonical\u0026rdquo; applications that have garnered much attention from the operations management community, and used these applications to highlight distinguishing features of sharing economy business models and to point out research questions that are new. The authors put in context some of the recent work on the sharing economy and to showcase the underlying modeling toolkit and identify opportunities for future research.\nA way to classify the model of sharing economics is\nPeer to peer resource sharing (LiquidSpace for office space, MachineryLink forfarm equipment, etc.) On-demand service platforms (Uber) On-demand rental networks (Halo Bike, ZipCar) At the center of the stage of sharing economic is the platform - who mediate the matching of demand and supply of shared resources. Platform natually possess information advantage (in general) and pricing privileges over the individual participants. So as proposed in Saif\u0026rsquo;s talk, most research questions are raised in view of the platform, for example\nHow should a platform match demand and supply, especially when resources/individual preferences are heterogeneous? Followingly, how should the price its services? How much effort should the platform exert in reducing (or in certain way, maybe intentionally increases?) market friction into the sharing system. These questions are more related to OM - revenue management! Notably, the last question (manipulating market friction) is more tricky and has some econ flavour.\nFor the market as a whole, questions are:\nWhat is the impact on ownership and usage, consumer surplus and social welfare of the shared economic? What is the impact on the environment, especially when there are negative externalities associated with either ownership or usage of the resource? (For example, cars). What interest me is the part about how much friction should (and can) the platfrom place on the market. Saif\u0026rsquo;s focused introducing the socially responsible espect and OM-ly revenue maximizing researches, which is practical, but I would prefer a little bit more strategic.

It would make a lovely blog.\nBtw, there\u0026rsquo;s a limite on word count and I got it done within two hours. Cheers to efficiency!\nIntroduction Bias and wisdom are not only involved around life-pivoting decisions. In the domain of gift-giving, economic thinkings matters. This review delves into the economic and behavioral aspects of gift-giving, primarily through the lens of two seminal papers: Joel Waldfogel\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas\u0026rdquo; (1993) and the subsequent analysis by Solnick and Hemenway (1996). These works challenge our conventional perceptions of gift value, offering a unique possibility on decision-making biases, where biases in perception and valuation can shape economic efficiency and personal satisfaction of a small act of loving gifts.\nAcademic Review Waldfogel\u0026rsquo;s Analysis (1993) The AER paper titled The Deadweight Loss of Christmas (Waldfogel, 1993) introduced this concept highlighting the economic inefficiencies in holiday gift-giving. It occurs when the gifts given do not align with the recipients\u0026rsquo; preferences, resulting in a lower overall satisfaction compared to if the recipients had made their own consumption choices with an equal amount of cash. The paper conducted empirical experiment on a field study among undergraduate students at Yale and estimated the deadweight loss to be between 10 percent and a third of the value of gifts (~87.1% in total). As holiday expenditures average $40 billion per year (around 1990s, according to the paper), the deadweight loss of Christmas, if estimated correctly, is tenth as large as the deadweight loss of income taxation. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of weird to see Santa Claus to be more economic-inefficient than Uncle Sam.\nThe study underscored the role of relationship closeness in gift efficiency. Gifts from friends and significant others were found to align closely with recipients\u0026rsquo; preferences, while those from extended family members were often less efficient, and are found to be the least efficient and can destroy a third of their value. This finding reflects a decision-making bias wherein the giver\u0026rsquo;s perception of the recipient\u0026rsquo;s preferences is clouded by their relationship distance.\nSolnick and Hemenway\u0026rsquo;s Follow-Up (1996) Solinick and Hemenway from Harvard University, who were intrigued enough by Waldfogel’s results, sought to replicate his experiment on general public interviewed at train stations and airports. Contrary to Waldfogel, SH find that gift-giving is actually welfare improving with an average yield of 214% (median yield 111%), so gifts created positive value rather than a deadweight loss.\nAnalysis of the Inconsistency This discrepancy in findings can be attributed to differences in survey methodology and participant demographics, raising questions about the influence of cognitive biases in gift valuation. Yet I would propose that the difference is caused by the design of the query in the first place. The problem lies in the way these two experiments ask for two major numbers in their survey: (i) how much money does the gift cost (retail price) and (ii) how much does it value to you. However, they framed it differently:\nIn Waldfogel\u0026rsquo;s paper, the question is worded as follows:\nHow much do you think the gift cost?\nApart from any sentimental value of the items, if you did not have them, how much would you be willing to pay to obtain them?\nWhile in SH\u0026rsquo;s paper, the questions is framed, this way:\nHow much do you think the giver spent?\nAside from any sentimental value, if, without the giver ever knowing, you could receive an amount of money instead of the gift, what is the minimum amount of money that would make you equally happy?\nDespite both experiments stressed the exclusion of sentimental value, SH\u0026rsquo;s paper described the gifts\u0026rsquo; valuation as \u0026ldquo;the minimum amount of money that would make you equally happy\u0026rdquo;. Their plain objective of this framing is to elicit the utility notion of general people without proper economic training.\nBut potential question arise. First, the inclusion of the word \u0026ldquo;happy\u0026rdquo; would still make participants difficult to separate pure value with sentimental add-ons. Second, SH\u0026rsquo;s paper state the value as \u0026ldquo;receive money in exchange for the gift\u0026rdquo; as Waldfogel\u0026rsquo;s paper state as \u0026ldquo;willingness to pay for the same item\u0026rdquo;. Hey, endowment effect warning here!\nTherefore, in conclusion, the Gift\u0026rsquo;s Value in these two researches are, actually, not the same thing, hence their results are incomparable in the first place, at least in some strictest sense.\nYet, combined the result of these two papers, insights arise. The mismatch of pure monetary utility of gifts creates a gap of its cost and perceived value of the recipients, while (even partial) sentimental value compensates the value and makes the gift more valuable, in terms of economic as well as emotional gain.\nImplications and Conclusion The intersection of gift-giving with the themes of bias and wisdom in decision-making is multifaceted. The bias, or more precisely, the emotionally re-evaluated value of gifts is an intrigue topic of behavioral economic study. Previous research were conducted under mainstream Western cultural context. However in Chinese culture, cash as gifts (red packages) are more accepted, and due to the practicality of people\u0026rsquo;s mindset, we can expect some interesting future direction and results lying here.\nThe resolution of deadweight loss in gift-giving could involve more universally acceptable gifts, like gift cards, balancing flexibility and emotional value. However, this strategy may inadvertently reduce the personalization and emotional impact of gifts, underscoring the complex interplay between economic efficiency and emotional satisfaction in decision-making.\nFrom a personal decision-making perspective, the wisdom lies in understanding and adapting to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s preferences, thus maximizing both economic value and emotional impact. A gift doesn’t have to cause absolute emotional devastation (in a good way) in order to be successful, nor does it have to be super expensive. According to the Waldfogel study, you\u0026rsquo;ll already be surpassing 98% others if you can match the value of your beloved ones even approximately. Just think, can I introduce someone to something they might not otherwise know about? Can I get them a nicer version of something than they would buy for themselves? Or can I make them feel seen? One of the three box ticked, and you\u0026rsquo;ll nail this upcoming Chirstmas and later Spring Festival.\nOne more thing to care about, is that one might extend your generosity to those on the periphery of your usual gift-receiving group, who might not have initially crossed your mind (as explained in yesterday\u0026rsquo;s blog). A small, thoughtful gift can have a high emotional impact at a relatively low monetary cost can be a lovely surprise for the people who aren\u0026rsquo;t expecting your gift, thus enhancing a social connection with a very low cost.\nIn summary, the study of gift-giving through the lenses of Waldfogel and Solnick and Hemenway offers profound insights into the biases inherent in our perceptions and decisions. It reveals that while economic efficiency is a valuable metric, the emotional dimensions of gift-giving embody a more complex and human aspect of decision-making, blending bias with wisdom in a tapestry of cultural, economic, and personal factors.\n","permalink":"/posts/deadweight_lost_of_gifts1/","summary":"A review of Waldfogel\u0026rsquo;s 1993 AER paper \u0026ldquo;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas\u0026rdquo;.","title":"unwrapping rationality: the bias and lovings of gifts"},{"content":"You may have heard of, or are familiar with, the concept of gift mismatch. A notable AER paper, \u0026lsquo;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas\u0026rsquo; by Waldfogel (1993), discussed this issue. Spanning just ten pages, the paper masterfully intertwines elegant theory with convincing experimental evidence.\nAt its core, the paper examines the difference between a gift\u0026rsquo;s cost to the giver and its perceived value to the recipient. This difference, primarily measured in monetary terms, is termed the \u0026ldquo;deadweight loss\u0026rdquo; of gift giving. The study reveals that our skewed perception of others\u0026rsquo; preferences can lead to a 10%-30% value mismatch, translating into significant economic loss—surpassing even the inefficiency caused by taxation.\nI wholeheartedly recommend this insightful paper for a thought-provoking morning read or as an enriching addition to your literary collection. From an economic standpoint, it\u0026rsquo;s true that gifts can result in deadweight loss. Thus, when selecting Christmas presents, it\u0026rsquo;s wise to aim for choices that closely align with the recipients\u0026rsquo; preferences.\nHowever, I propose an additional angle to consider. This Christmas, why not slightly broaden the circle of people you usually gift to? Extend your generosity to those on the periphery of your usual gift-receiving group, who might not have initially crossed your mind.\nThis approach is beneficial for two reasons. Firstly, the value of a gift can be bifurcated into monetary and emotional components. The latter, being highly subjective and malleable, can vary greatly if skillfully presented. Surprising someone unexpectedly can significantly boost the emotional value of a gift, especially when it makes the recipient feel noticed and valued. A modest gift to an acquaintance, for instance, can leave them pleasantly surprised and feeling appreciated, which is invaluable. Moreover, this gesture doesn\u0026rsquo;t require an extravagant expenditure. A small, thoughtful gift can have a high emotional impact at a relatively low monetary cost, enhancing a social connection with a simple act.\nAs Christmas and the New Year approach, I encourage you to try this alternate gifting method. Extend your generosity not only to your closest colleagues and mentors but also consider small tokens for others in your circle—like the class you teach, a professor of a lesser-known course, or acquaintances you frequently encounter but seldom engage with. Regardless of the economic or social benefits anyway, such gifts have the potential to brighten someone\u0026rsquo;s day in an extraordinary way.\n","permalink":"/posts/deadweight_lost_of_gifts/","summary":"the unexpected value in gift-giving, beyong deadweight loss","title":"unwrapping joy - thoughful gift giving beyong monetary measures"},{"content":"In the bias and wisdom in decision making course that I\u0026rsquo;ve taken this semester, we featured the topic intertemperal choice today.

Their stories, though diverge in market realities and cultural perceptions, offer a vivid insight of market dynamics from agricultural pracise.\nApples of ShaanXi: A Struggle Against Odds ShaanXi province overcamed poverty, benefited from the apple growing industry over the last 40 year, after the opening up of Xiaoping Deng\nIn the rugged terrain of ShaanXi, family-owned apple farms face a relentless battle. The market here features a complex weave of decentralized transactions between the apple farmers and the merchants, dancing around fluctuating demand and unpredictable, competitive pricing.\nThe Market Dynamics: Farmers vs. Merchants At the heart of this dynamic is a tense competition between farmers and merchants, each striving for marginal gains in this hardly lucrative business. Farmers, aiming to maximize profits, often resort to strategically freezing their apples to sell later in the year when supply is scarce (compared to harvest season) and apple prices potentially rise. Merchants, on the other hand, aim to purchase high-quality apples at the lowest possible price.\nThis decentralized and unorganized supply chain, driven by individual utility optimization, results in a market where farmer\u0026rsquo;s bargaining power is minimal and the market is highly volatile, but neither party feels comfortable. Farmers cheat the merchants and mix up good/bad apples, while merchants are becoming more and more picky. Each party place minimal trust upon the other.\nFarmers\u0026rsquo; Struggle Against Odds For the apple farmers, it\u0026rsquo;s a constant balancing act between risk, quality, and quantity. Despite their efforts, the business is far from lucrative. Even in the best years, an apple farm\u0026rsquo;s annual sales might barely reach ¥200,000 for the entire family.\nThe farmers find themselves playing against probabilities on two fronts: the unpredictability of nature, where extreme weather, pests, and diseases pose constant threats; and the overwhelming forces of supply and demand, where their minimal bargaining power often leads to hasty or ill-informed decisions about whether to sell immediately or store the apples in hopes of better future prices.\nA Hard-Fought Livelihood The farmers, despite being owner of their land, but feels more like slaves of their apple trees. Tirelessly working in a business that barely sustains their livelihoods and the future of their children, it\u0026rsquo;s really like their lively hood being at the mercy of elements beyond one\u0026rsquo;s control. Yet, this poignant reality is underscored by the sarcastic yet resonant comment beneath an article about some of their stubborn and plight:\nKeep hoarding it, don\u0026rsquo;t sell. The price will definitely catch up to the iPhone 16.\nBut the problem isn\u0026rsquo;t really the shortminded-ness of the farmers. When a design of a market fail, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the strategic agent to take all the blame, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nCranberries: A Success Story The famous \u0026lsquo;flood\u0026rsquo; harvest of cranberries.\nContrastingly, the world of cranberries tells a tale of innovation and success. Ocean Spray, a leading cranberry cooperative, epitomizes this narrative. Accounting for 65% of the world’s cranberry supply, the company exempt from antitrust regulations due to a 1922 federal law, benefits from collective scale and power:\nThis would be unusual in most industries, but it’s surprisingly common in agriculture. The model for Ocean Spray, Dairy Farmers of America and Land O’Lakes became popular because of a 1922 federal law that exempts cooperatives from antitrust regulations, allowing farmers to pool their resources for scale and collective power.\nBen Cohen, These People Are Responsible for the Cranberry Sauce You Love to Hate\nOcean Spray\u0026rsquo;s model is a unique fusion of traditional agriculture and modern business strategies. It has invested many millions in innovations and have world-class scientists and marketing teams working around it, likecreating novel food products and even, leveraging social media trends:\nOcean Spray hired two granfluencers, including one the same age as the cooperative itself, to ask their millions of followers on social media the holiday’s most polarizing question: Team Homemade or Team Canned?\nImpressive.\nLooking Ahead\u0026hellip; I love both of these fruits, in terms of eating. The resilience and innovation seen in the cranberry industry could potentially inspire a transformation in the apple orchards of ShaanXi. The hope is that, with time, these apple farmers will find ways to modernize and thrive, just as their cranberry counterparts have.\nReference [The cranberry article] Cohen, B. (2023, Nov. 17).

Interestingly, two out of twelve student groups chose to focus on the \u0026ldquo;Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Box\u0026rdquo; survey. This topic is a mature stream of research, stretching from Weizmann\u0026rsquo;s seminal 1979 paper to recent comprehensive surveys that bridge economics and computer science. The survey in SIGecom Exchanges is particularly thorough, allowing both groups to base their presentations entirely on its content, resulting in nearly identical talks.\nImagine a scenario with several boxes containing prizes of unknown value. These values follow independent distributions $F$, varying from box to box. Opening a box to reveal its value incurs a \u0026ldquo;search cost\u0026rdquo; $c$. The basic premise is that you can take away one box from those opened, ideally the one with the highest prize. The decision-maker must strategize whether to continue opening boxes, incurring additional costs, or to stop and choose the best box thus far.\nThe optimal search strategy, while the problem seems complex, is surprisingly straightforward. For every box, we define an \u0026ldquo;index value\u0026rdquo; θ by solving $$ \\mathbb E[v - \\theta]^+ = c. $$ The search process involves starting with the box with the highest θ, opening it, and if its prize value exceeds θ, we stop and take the box; otherwise, we continue searching. We\u0026rsquo;ll left the proof of this strategy\u0026rsquo;s optimality as a teaser.\nGive a potentially interesting economic question to those TCS scientists and they can complicate the matter in hundreds of ways. Just kidding. This concept of \u0026ldquo;search with cost under uncertainty\u0026rdquo; has significant implications and is popular over the recent decade, as evidenced by Peter Diamond\u0026rsquo;s Nobel Prize for his contributions to search theory in economics. Various adaptations of the original Pandora\u0026rsquo;s box model have been explored. One intriguing variation is the option to \u0026ldquo;take away a box without opening it\u0026rdquo;. For example, some searcher just run out of patience and be like \u0026ldquo;screw it I\u0026rsquo;ll just take that remaining un-opened box with the highest potential prize\u0026rdquo;. But, this small adjustment makes finding the optimal strategy NP-hard.\nThe relevance of search theory is underscored by information asymmetry and the challenges in acquiring additional information. For instance, the choice of the Pandora\u0026rsquo;s box topic by the student groups likely stemmed from its prominent placement on the SIGecom Exchanges website, like:\nThe survey of Pandora\u0026rsquo;s box is placed at the centre of the main page of the website. When the students open the website, they may find Pandora\u0026rsquo;s box as a topic to be potentially interesting enough (high realized value) and hence don\u0026rsquo;t have the incentive to search for other papers over the previous years, thus\u0026hellip; picking this survey and go away.\nFeatured as the only survey in the June 2023 issue, it is immediately visible upon visiting the site. Additionally, the intriguing title \u0026ldquo;Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Box\u0026rdquo; likely drew more interest than other more daunting terms, reducing mental aversion. It seems students often gravitate towards topics that appear interesting and accessible, which led to the unfortunate crash in presentation topics.\nCompounding the issue, as the TA, I scheduled these identical presentations back-to-back. The second group faces the challenge of presenting the same material immediately after the first. It will be interesting to see how they manage to engage the audience with their take on Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Box. Good luck.\n","permalink":"/posts/pandora/","summary":"In a humorous twist of fate, our mechanism design course unveils the curious case of two student groups unwittingly mirroring each other\u0026rsquo;s presentations on Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Box, spotlighting the ironic interplay of choice and chance in academic endeavors.","title":"Echoes in Pandora's Box"},{"content":"Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the opportunity to attend various academic talks - from job market pitches to regular paper presentations and class lectures. In each of these, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a ubiquitous element: the reliance on slides, whether they\u0026rsquo;re sleek, LaTeX-generated PDFs or classic PowerPoint decks.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an unspoken rule in academia these days: not using slides is almost tantamount to disrespect. It\u0026rsquo;s as if you\u0026rsquo;ve shown up unprepared. Slides have become the academic equivalent of a formal suit – a symbol of seriousness and professionalism. Ironically, even a well-tailored suit and a meticulously prepared lecture script fall short without the accompanying visual aid of slides. This holds true for most academic settings, except perhaps for a few math-intensive courses.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the catch: effectively using slides is no simple feat. Even the most minimalist slide deck, a mere collection of formulas, can be challenging to wield. Slides possess such a potent allure that many fall into their trap. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen students, overwhelmed, resort to merely reading off the slides, leading to lackluster presentations. Likewise, lecturers sometimes pack their slides with excessive detail, only to lose track of their sequence. They end up covering content orally and then redundantly repeating it as they switch to the next slide, having forgotten its contents.\nThat universal gesture we make when referring to a crucial point on our slides, especially mathematical statements. It\u0026rsquo;s become almost a cliché, seen repeatedly in literally everyone\u0026rsquo;s talk everytime.\nUsing slides is really like wielding a double-edged sword. The benefits and pitfalls are nearly equal. Today, it\u0026rsquo;s rare to encounter a lengthy academic talk sans slides. However, it\u0026rsquo;s equally common to see speakers led by their slides, rather than leading the talk themselves. This calls for a thoughtful approach to the design and use of slides.\nAdding to the complexity is the setup of modern lecture rooms. The rise of multiple display systems has inadvertently raised the stakes. In such environments, audiences often disengage, focusing on the slides and merely listening to the speaker. This disconnect between audio and visual inputs leaves the speaker with only their voice to command attention.\nObservations on room design: The left room, oddly, features two screens showing the same content in a widely spaced setting, making audience engagement challenging. The right room, with its daunting five-screen setup, presents an even greater challenge in capturing and maintaining audience attention.\nNavigating rooms with dual screens can be disorienting, especially when juggling content and audience engagement. The ultimate test, though, comes in rooms like the one I recently encountered: a 20-person class surrounded by five screens. Here, capturing and retaining the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention felt like an arduous battle.\n","permalink":"/posts/talks_and_talks/","summary":"Navigating the tricky balance of engaging and informative slides in academic talks, where visuals can both command and complement the narrative.","title":"slide into success - Mastering Visual Aids in Academic Presentations"},{"content":"Earlier this week, a post touched on the murky world of fake reviews. A pivotal 2021 study in SIGecom Exchanges by He et al. delved into this labyrinth on the behemoth platform, Amazon. The dance between third-party sellers, consumers, and the platform itself is somewhat like a strategic ballet, with each trying to outmaneuver the other for a sliver of extra margin. It\u0026rsquo;s an intricate competitive ecosystem where strategy meets survival.\nIn the shadows of Amazon\u0026rsquo;s marketplace, a clandestine trend thrives: sellers acquiring fake reviews through Facebook private chat groups. The allure persists despite Amazon\u0026rsquo;s prohibition of this practice. After all, Amazon\u0026rsquo;s algorithm favors products with higher sales and stellar reviews, catapulting them into the limelight, which in turn boosts sales. Therefore, buying fake reviews is like unilaterally deviating from the honest strategy and it seems to be beneficial, at least in the short term.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s study in 2021 took a deep dive into this underworld. The researchers played 007, in a stroke of investigative genius, infiltrated Facebook groups dedicated to fake reviews. They meticulously tracked brands engaging in this deceit, monitoring their sales performance, keyword rankings, and other tangible metrics. Their statistical analysis focused on the performance of these sellers around the time they purchased fake reviews. Coinciding with this, Amazon\u0026rsquo;s 2020 \u0026lsquo;purge\u0026rsquo; of reviews - a heightened effort to delete dubious feedback - provided a unique backdrop. This allowed the researchers to employ a \u0026lsquo;difference-in-difference\u0026rsquo; approach, isolating the impact of fake reviews from other promotional tactics.\nThe findings were stark: in the short term, fake reviews significantly boosted ratings, keyword positioning, and sales. However, the long-term story painted a different picture. For most sellers, the artificially inflated ratings eventually plummeted, often accompanied by a surge in scathing one-star reviews from genuinely disgruntled customers who had been misled. The repercussions of these manipulated ratings are far-reaching, eroding consumer trust and introducing a toxic competitive environment.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not a static competition either. Consumers are adapting, increasingly valuing genuine negative reviews over suspiciously perfect ratings. Platforms, too, are evolving, refining algorithms to spotlight sellers of genuine merit. (There has been papers in both aspects.) But perhaps the real solution lies beyond mere system tweaks. Imagine a reimagined rating mechanism that fosters transparent, honest interactions between consumers and sellers, showcasing authentic, valuable information. A utopian idea? Perhaps. But the one who cracks this code might just be a contender for a Nobel Prize in Economics.

Professor Hubert Pun from Ivey Business School graced SUFE with his presence and insights, discussing his research: \u0026ldquo;Counterfeiting and Traceability in Secondary Markets.\u0026rdquo;\nCertificates of the authenticity of luxury goods aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily real, especially on the secondary market. Counterfeiters are adept at creating fakes that are often sold at prices comparable to genuine products. And even, sometimes people knowingly buy fake items, like knock-off LV bags, just for the logo.\nHowever, luxury brands such as Chow Tai Fook and LVMH are now employing blockchain technology to infallibly certify their products. This technology ensures that every item, from luxury watches to diamonds, has a traceable and tamper-proof digital history. For instance, Chow Tai Fook is using blockchain-based QR codes to verify the authenticity of their diamonds.\nProfessor Pun\u0026rsquo;s paper presents a market model involving original manufacturers, consumers, counterfeit sellers, and legitimate second-hand mediators. The market dynamics are explored through a two-period game. In the first period, consumers buy true products from the original manufacturer. In the second period, the secondary market comes into play, with both genuine and counterfeit products being resold.\nThe secondary market is where the blockchain technology wields its power. Manufaturers can choose to enable blockchain-powered verification, letting consumers become shrewd detectives, separating the faux from the real, choosing what maximizes their utility. Absent this, counterfeits could masquerade as genuine by pricing themselves at the same level as the authentic products.\nHowever, the equilibrium results are a plot twist. Blockchain transparency doesn\u0026rsquo;t always benefit everyone. In certain scenarios, like when counterfeit products almost mirror real luxury goods in value, the good guys (truthful second-hand mediators) might find themselves worse off. The increased competition spurred by consumer discernment can hurt original manufacturers and lower prices, which impacts the mediators.\nThis research brilliantly intertwines operations management (OM) and game theory economics. It\u0026rsquo;s reminiscent of information design, likening blockchain verification to providing perfect information. Classic information design result yields, most of the time, perfect information won\u0026rsquo;t be the best solution, and that certain degree of obfucating the information would be beneficial to at least some parties in the game. And this remarkable insight works here as well.\nWhat captivated me about this research is how its elegant mathematical modeling deeply rooted in real-world scenarios. Growing up in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the secondary luxury market firsthand, and Professor Pun\u0026rsquo;s abstractions hit close to home. His presentation was nothing short of spectacular, a testament to his popularity in MBA classrooms across FDU and Xiamen University.\nThe talk concluded with an insightful Q\u0026amp;A session. When asked about his inspiration, Professor Pun emphasized engaging with industry insiders and immersing himself in the subject. It\u0026rsquo;s a reminder that great ideas are born from dedication.\nThis fruitful afternoon left me grateful for my bestie\u0026rsquo;s reminder about the talk. Our casual exchange:\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, any plans?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Heading to a talk this afternoon.

But recently, an unexpected player has entered the arena – bead bracelets. Once relegated to the realms of middle-aged men\u0026rsquo;s curiosity, these trinkets, be it wooden, amber, or jeweled, are now the latest craze among the youth. Why, you ask? Well, the reasons are as layered as the beads themselves.\nFirstly, there\u0026rsquo;s been a surge in superstition among the younger generation. A growing number turn to temples and age-old beliefs, seeking luck and protection in the face of an uncertain world. Bead bracelets, traditionally considered conduits of mystical powers, have become symbols of this newfound spirituality.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026lsquo;old money\u0026rsquo; allure. Youngsters are donning these bracelets not just as fashion statements, but as emblems of a certain understated wealth and success, emulating the attire of the affluent older generation.\nIn the bustling heart of our college\u0026rsquo;s downtown business district, this trend has given birth to a new type of retail outlet. These aren\u0026rsquo;t your average street-side shops; rather, they\u0026rsquo;re modern, chain stores, each vying for the attention of bead bracelet enthusiasts. Take, for instance, the two stores nestled within the HopSon Mall – sleek, contemporary, and oh-so-youthful. But don\u0026rsquo;t let the shiny exterior fool you. The price tag of 600 RMB upwards might seem steep, especially considering the use of commonplace materials like wood or plastic. Jade or gold? Those are rarities here.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker – these stores don\u0026rsquo;t seem built to last. They\u0026rsquo;re geared towards fleeting trends, catering to the whims of young consumers rather than true aficionados. Think fast fashion, but for bead bracelets – mass-produced beads, machine-strung, lacking the charm and quality of genuine handcrafting. Lame.\nThis brings me to my own bead bracelet saga. Needing an adjustment, I ventured not into these modern emporiums but to a more traditional bracelet knitting store. Tucked away on the third floor of an unassuming apartment building, this place is a hidden gem that demands effort to discover. Here, the atmosphere is less retail, more homely – complete with a sun-drenched balcony and cozy sofas for waiting customers.\nThe owner, a seasoned artisan in his 60s, shared his concerns about the challenges faced by traditional businesses in an increasingly online world. He lamented the superficiality of mall-based competitors and the high rents that pushed him from a prime street-level location to this quieter nook. For context, a small ground-floor shop on DaXueLu street can fetch a rent of 50,000 to 100,000 RMB monthly, while this upstairs apartment 5 times larger haven costs a mere 20,000 RMB.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s a thought: perhaps there\u0026rsquo;s still a place for such traditional craftsmanship in our fast-paced world. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just about buying a bracelet; it\u0026rsquo;s an experience – choosing colors, assembling beads, and engaging in warm conversation. It\u0026rsquo;s a salon of sorts for the soul. Trust me, in a city like Shanghai where affluence and ennui often walk hand in hand, it is never in lack of crazily rich yet bored people seeking an emotional sanctuary to spare time and spend money.\nOh, and about my bracelet – fixed in a mere five minutes for a modest 15 RMB. My utility is positive, if you\u0026rsquo;d asked me.\n","permalink":"/posts/amber_bracelet/","summary":"In a city like Shanghai where affluence and ennui often walk hand in hand, it is never in lack of crazily rich yet bored people seeking an emotional sanctuary to spare time and spend money.","title":"the bead bracelet boom"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of to-read papers, books, and blogs.

It promised to be a low-key yet entertaining evening.\nAlso, something piqued my interest as an economics enthusiast. The host announced they were giving away free souvenirs – a glass cup or a bag – but with a twist. To claim these, audience members had to post a positive review on DianPing, complete with photos and a minimum character count. It was a straightforward transaction: our positive feedback for their free merchandise.\nThis scenario is a classic example of a \u0026lsquo;quid pro quo\u0026rsquo; in a consumer market, a simple yet effective economic exchange. Businesses, be they talk shows or restaurants, are leveraging the power of consumer reviews on platforms like DianPing and XiaoHongShu.

It counters the typical trend where customers are more inclined to leave reviews after negative experiences. This shift can potentially lead to a more balanced representation of service quality.\nYet, there\u0026rsquo;s a caveat. The authenticity of reviews can be compromised, potentially leading to information inefficiency. When reviews are incentivized, they might not accurately reflect the true consumer experience, and furthermore be inflated in terms of quantity thus skewing the recommendation algorithms of these platforms. It\u0026rsquo;s a delicate balance between enhancing business visibility and maintaining the integrity of consumer feedback.\nAs for my experience, I left with a free water cup and plans to return in the future.

Principle theorem:\nIn order not to crash all your deadlines, factor in extra time while planning.\nThe root of the issue lies partly in impulse control. We\u0026rsquo;re wired to seek immediate gratification rather than long-term rewards. Additionally, we often fall prey to optimism bias in our planning, underestimating the time needed for tasks. This combination of procrastination and poor planning can lead to disastrous outcomes if not managed properly.\nThis personal tendency has led to a backlog in my blog content.

Finding that \u0026rsquo;lightning point\u0026rsquo; in your research, and ignite curiosity in the most unsuspecting minds. It\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;romancing the elevator\u0026rdquo;, like a crafted, prepared impromptus speech, where every word counts, and every sentence is a step towards unraveling the essence of your work.\nAnd, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this art in action. At a lunch table in Stanford, a PhD student from Princeton had the daunting task of presenting her research to Paul Milgrom. I was there, marveling at how she weaved her narrative - precise, deep yet accessible. It was a performance I couldn\u0026rsquo;t fathom replicating at the time.\nThe ability of impressing a Nobel Laureate within an ride of the elevator or a potential mentor at a conference tea break is nothing short of vital. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to understand your research and other\u0026rsquo;s mind as well, like breaking the barriers that jargon and complexity build, and letting the true essence of your research shine through. In the end, it\u0026rsquo;s not just about being understood; it\u0026rsquo;s about being remembered.\n","permalink":"/posts/romancing_the_elevator/","summary":"In the labyrinth of academia, where jargon is the king and complexity its crown jewel, I\u0026rsquo;ve often found myself knee-deep in the weeds of technical details.

We exchange our precious time, hoping to gain something intangible yet potentially valuable. This meeting, with its ceremonial grandeur, was a perfect example to reflect on this paradox.\nOur school had transformed the largest meeting room into a spectacle. A massive circular table dominated the center, surrounded by a hundred student volunteers, including myself. It resembled less of a meeting and more of a performance, a ceremonial act where real discussions were replaced by pre-decided scripts and roles.\nThis spectacle got me thinking about the different types of meetings we attend and their true purpose. On the surface, meetings are about idea exchange, collaboration, and expanding one\u0026rsquo;s network. Yet, as I observed at this event, they can often turn into mere vanity fairs.\nConsider the attendees: there were the necessary functional figures like the principal and board members, whose presence was crucial. Then, there were \u0026lsquo;fillers\u0026rsquo;, department heads roped in to create an aura of importance. Their role was akin to an audience at a concert - necessary for the performers but passive in participation.\nIn typical meetings, attendees\u0026rsquo; roles vary according to their status and objectives. At the top are keynote speakers and distinguished guests, followed by those above a certain \u0026rsquo;threshold\u0026rsquo; who aim to expand their influence. Then come the participants hovering around or below this threshold, seeking to \u0026lsquo;socialize upwards\u0026rsquo; by absorbing new ideas or building connections. And, of course, there are people like me - volunteers or attendees primarily there for the fringe benefits, like networking breaks or, in my case, delicious cakes and free merchandise.\nBut who truly benefits from such meetings? In the case of our board meeting, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t an enriching ground for meaningful exchanges or learning. The formality and lack of diverse specialties among attendees made it less than ideal for genuine interaction. While the board members and principal needed this exposure, I wondered if they found any joy in the lengthy, exhausting proceedings.\nFor us volunteers, though, the day wasn\u0026rsquo;t without its perks. I walked away with a free hoodie, some quality stationery, and my fill of snacks and fresh juice that later I even shared with friends. So, in a way, my time was well-compensated.\nAs I reflect on this experience, I realize that the value of meetings lies not just in their content but also in their context. The true worth of any meeting, be it a high-profile board gathering or a casual team huddle, hinges on the genuine connections made and the knowledge exchanged - elements that were notably absent in the spectacle I witnessed.\nMeetings, therefore, are a complex blend of necessity, opportunity, and sometimes, mere formality. The challenge lies in discerning which meetings warrant our time and which are merely grand stages for the age-old dance of vanity.\n","permalink":"/posts/board_meeting/","summary":"As I walked into the grandiose setting of our school\u0026rsquo;s annual board meeting, a thought struck me - meetings are a peculiar trade-off.

However, my experience was mixed. The processing speed was sluggish, and the output generation seemed unstable. Especially during lengthy data analysis tasks, the system struggled, indicating that it might not yet be fully optimized for complex, long-sequence outputs. Moreover, encountering an error—like a connection loss—meant restarting the entire process from scratch, a time-consuming and frustrating ordeal.\nFinding the Sweet Spot Despite these challenges, I found that ChatGPT excels in short debugging and coding suggestion sessions. It adeptly simplifies verbose code blocks. For example, it condensed a dictionary creation process in Python from a for-loop to a more concise dictionary comprehension:\n# Before voter_to_region_dict = {} for voter, region in zip(unified_df[\u0026#39;Voter_Name\u0026#39;], unified_df[\u0026#39;Region\u0026#39;]): voter_to_region_dict[voter] = region # After voter_to_region_dict = dict(zip(unified_df[\u0026#39;Voter_Name\u0026#39;], unified_df[\u0026#39;Region\u0026#39;])) The Role of ChatGPT in Data Analysis In the current landscape, ChatGPT is best utilized as a support tool—a digital assistant or co-pilot—in coding and data analysis. It\u0026rsquo;s akin to having a first-year PhD student or a research assistant: helpful, but not a replacement for the meticulous work involved in data cleaning and analysis.\nMy Experience with Ballon d\u0026rsquo;Or Data I put ChatGPT to the test with the Ballon d\u0026rsquo;Or dataset, seeking its assistance in data cleaning and analysis. Unfortunately, the new data analysis feature fell short of expectations. Eventually, I resorted to guiding ChatGPT through step-by-step prompts for data cleaning, suggesting analysis schemes, and refining the approach through detailed fine-tuning. I executed the final code on my computer, preferring the familiarity of my terminal with its Monaco font.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a visualization I created using ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance: (btw, the data-cleaning process is tedious and not presented here.

The core is a pretty general LP optimization problem that capture the high-level constraint of the buyer (advertiser), based on the data known, solve an optimal ads assortment. Like the following: $$ \\begin{align} \\max \u0026amp;\\ \\sum_i x_iv_i\\ s.t. \u0026amp; \\ \\sum_i x_i\\text{cpc}i \\le B_c + \\sum_i x_i w{ic}\\ \u0026amp; x_i\\in {0, 1} \\end{align} $$ where $c$ is the index for the buyer, $i\\in [m]$ is the index for the items. $B$ stands for budget (generally) and $w_{ic}$ and $v_i$ would correspond to weight and value in general.\nThis framework is \u0026ldquo;general\u0026rdquo;. It can model budget-constrained optimizer who, as long as his budget is not exceeded, would like to maximize clicks, i.e. $\\sum_i x_i$, then by taking $v_i = 1, B_c = \\text{budget},w_i = 0$ we obtain the speical case of the above LP tailored for budget-constrained click-count optimizers: $$ \\begin{align} \\max \u0026amp;\\ \\sum_i x_i\\ s.t. \u0026amp; \\ \\sum_i x_i \\le B_c \\ \u0026amp; x_i\\in {0, 1}\\text{ (or maybe } 0\\le x_i\\le 1) \\end{align} $$ And for optimizer with a CPA (cost-per-acquisition) target, let $v_i = \\text{cvr}_i$ (convergence rate) and $B = 0$, and take $w_i = T\\text{cvr}_i$, the optimization program yields $$ \\begin{align} \\max \u0026amp;\\ \\sum_i \\text{cvr}_i x_i\\ s.t. \u0026amp; \\ \\frac{\\sum_i x_i\\text{cpc}_i}{\\sum_i x_i \\text{cvr}_i} \\le T \\ \u0026amp; x_i\\in {0, 1}\\text{ (or maybe } 0\\le x_i\\le 1) \\end{align} $$ Cool.

I\u0026rsquo;ve gained a wealth of knowledge, and in today\u0026rsquo;s blog, I want to share a simple yet thought-provoking exercise from our recent homework. This exercise is designed to be accessible yet stimulating, introducing students to the process of bounding the Price of Anarchy (POA). Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in:\nQuestion: Background: In a selfish-routing game, consider the following theorem: the Nash Equilibrium (NE) cost of a flow with total quantity $r$ is no more than the optimal cost with total quantity $2r$, for any set of cost functions.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s narrow down our focus to affine cost functions, i.e. for each edge if the flow on it is $f_e$, traversing it incurs a cost $c_e(f_e) = af_e + b$.\nProblems: (i) Given any affine $c(x) = ax + b$ with $a, b \\ge 0$, for any non-negative $x, x^{*}$ show that $$ x^{*}(c(x) - c(x^{*}))\\le \\frac14xc(x) $$\n(ii) Under the assumption of linear costs, prove that the cost of the Nash Equilibrium flow of total quantity $r$ is at most the optimal cost of a flow loaded with $\\frac54 r$.\nSolution: (i) To verify the inequality, let\u0026rsquo;s consider the difference between the right side and the left side: $\\frac14 xc(x) - x^{*}(c(x) - c(x^{*}))$ and using the fact that $c(x)$ is affine: $$ \\frac 14x(ax + b) - x^{*}(ax - ax^{*}) = a(x^{*} - \\frac14 x)^2 + \\frac 14 bx\\ge 0. $$\n(ii) If we \u0026ldquo;freeze\u0026rdquo; all edge costs at their equilibrium being $c_e (f_e)$, then the equilibrium flow ${f_e}_{e\\in E}$ is the optimal flow out of all else possible flows that preserves total flow quantity. Then, consider optimal flow solution on the same network with total quantity $\\frac 54 r$, denoted as $f^{*}_e$:\n$$ \\sum_{e\\in E}(\\frac 45f_e^{*} - f_e )c_e(f_e)\\ge 0. $$ We then have $$ \\sum_{e\\in E} f_e c_e(f_e)\\le\\frac45 \\sum_{e\\in E} f_e^{*}c_e(f_e) = \\frac45\\sum_{e\\in E}(f_e^{*} c_e(f_e^{*}) + \\frac14 f_ec_e(f_e)), $$ which infers: $$ NE(r)\\le \\frac 45 OPT(\\frac54 r) + \\frac15 NE(r)\\Leftrightarrow NE(r) \\le OPT(\\frac54 r). $$ I hope this exercise sparks anyone\u0026rsquo;s interest in the intricacies of market mechanism design and the beauty of mathematical proofs (if you\u0026rsquo;re not in this field yet).

His focus? The impact of generative AI on intellectual property, a topic that\u0026rsquo;s as complex as it is fascinating.\nIain is an impressive public speaker, which brings to mind James Wagstaffe, my public speaking professor who also practices law. They each have their unique style, but both command the room with ease. Iain\u0026rsquo;s presentation was not only rich in content but delivered with such fluency it was genuinely inspiring.\nThis talk has stayed with me, lingering in my thoughts for days. It came in handy when I was preparing a presentation for my machine learning class. While others were planning brief overviews of cutting-edge techniques—given our ten-minute time limit so that they\u0026rsquo;re unavoidable shallow, which sucks—I aimed for something unique. So, I revisited Iain\u0026rsquo;s talk, thankfully available on YouTube, and a tip of the hat to Steve Jones, the remarkable professor who organized these sessions.\nAt the heart of Iain\u0026rsquo;s discussion was the question: Should AI-generated art be copyrightable? He began with a look at the history of intellectual property rights, particularly the debate over photograph copyright in the 19th century—a debate as contentious then as AI copyright is today. The evolution of technology inevitably brings about new legal and ethical considerations, and AI-generated content is the latest frontier.\nOne of the talk\u0026rsquo;s highlights was, after Iain\u0026rsquo;s reference to the Burrow-Giles Lithographic Company v. Sarony case, the storied copyright dispute over an Oscar Wilde portrait, he explained the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s 1884 decision underscored that creative motivation is key to copyright claims, which quoted:\n\u0026ldquo;For example, if a photography club visited the National Mall and photographed the Washington Monument, each photographer would have a separate claim in his or her individual photographs\u0026hellip; Each photographer made individual creative choices.\u0026rdquo;\nThen, Iain used this as a springboard to discuss originality and creativity, juxtaposing Supreme Court reasoning with modern issues. His next move was a stroke of genius: he showed us a series of mediocre, internet-searched photographs of the Washington Monument, made us \u0026ldquo;appreciate\u0026rdquo; the originality and creativity of these casually taken pictures that enjoys copyrights, and posed a question that elevated the discussion:\n\u0026ldquo;Because, by the way, can you tell which of these photographs is generated by AI?\u0026rdquo;\nIt was a moment that perfectly encapsulated the essence of great public speaking. But let\u0026rsquo;s pivot back to the core issue. AI\u0026rsquo;s capabilities have grown to the point where content can be generated with minimal human effort—just a text prompt can lead to stunningly vivid outputs. The machine\u0026rsquo;s ability to create \u0026lsquo;original\u0026rsquo; work blurs the lines of creativity and human involvement in the process.\nJon Stokes captures this sentiment succinctly:\n\u0026ldquo;People are now using AI tools to generate high-quality, original artwork with vanishingly little ego, time, or money invested. In fact, in most cases, the total investment in any of those three things is essentially zero.\u0026rdquo;\nThe human element influences, but does not dictate, AI. The generative process often begins with something as nondescript as Gaussian noise, incorporating a degree of randomness that makes each output unique—even with identical prompts.\nThe conversation about AI and copyright law is far from settled, and I anticipate even more vigorous debates as technology progresses. We must evolve with AI, adapting our laws to regulate and encourage creativity effectively. Yet, perhaps due to AI\u0026rsquo;s unprecedented boundary-pushing, we may also need to reconsider our very definitions of intellectual property.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s indeed a privilege to live in such a groundbreaking era.

Different from the standard interior point method which relies on a costly Newton step, ABIP applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to approximately solve the barrier penalized problem. In this paper, we provide a new version of ABIP with several improvements. First, we develop some new implementation strategies to accelerate ABIP\u0026rsquo;s performance for linear programming. Next, we extend ABIP to solving the more general linear conic programming and establish the associated iteration complexity of the algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the empirical advantage of our developments. In particular, the enhanced ABIP achieves a 5.8x reduction in the geometric mean of run time on 105 LP instances from Netlib and it compares favorably against state-of-the-art open-source solvers in a wide range of large-scale problems. Moreover, it is even comparable to the commercial solvers in some particular datasets.\nToday, a PhD student presented their research at the undergrad-kick-off workshop (pending formal name). While the method (ADMM + interior point) isn\u0026rsquo;t novel, they applied performance-enhancing techniques, demonstrated some theoretical results, and tested the results on LP benchmarks. They also extended the method to tackle convex problems, which yielded promising performance.\nThe key highlight was that the student\u0026rsquo;s method only requires decomposing the input matrix once, making it an almost \u0026ldquo;matrix-free\u0026rdquo; approach. This decomposition aims to expedite the inner ADMM iteration by reducing the condition number of the original input constraint matrix (akin to the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue).\nCoincidentally, I bumped into the PhD student in the school elevator later today. He\u0026rsquo;s certainly very proud of his work and quite possess some attitude.

Around 00:05, when all public transportation had stopped running, I had no option but to order a Didi taxi, a service similar to Uber, to return to my dormitory. To my surprise, a driver quickly accepted my request, indicating that the demand was relatively low.\nOnce in the vehicle, feeling tired but I struck up a conversation with the driver. Instantly he began to\u0026hellip;complain, stating that working as a Didi driver was not profitable. He revealed that his car was rented, which meant he had to remain an active driver, unlike those who owned their vehicles and could choose when to work. On a daily basis, assuming he covered approximately 350 kilometers, his operational costs, including expenses like meals, vehicle rental, and fuel, amounted to roughly ¥1.2 per kilometer.\nAs a benchmark, traditional taxi services in Shanghai charge ¥2.4 per kilometer, with a starting fixed fee of ¥14 for the initial 3 kilometers, and an increased rate of ¥3.6 per kilometer during nighttime hours. Didi\u0026rsquo;s platform, on the other hand, has more flexibility in pricing while immense market power. The money that a driver gets (net) is about 1.5~2.1. Didi serves as an intermediary, matching supply with demand and strategically controlling pricing to extract surplus from both drivers and passengers.\nThe process is somewhat similar to an online matching problem. When a consumer requests a ride and enters a virtual queue, the platform dispatches this request to a subset of available drivers, with the first driver to accept the request completing the journey. Didi prescribes the route, penalizing deviations from this course, and charges a fee similar to traditional taxi services.\nWhen ordered from the customer\u0026rsquo;s side, Didi offers multiple options with different prices. But the outlined pink ones, despite different in price, is actually the same. So they\u0026rsquo;re only different in terms of wait-time, potentially. Btw, benchmark traditional taxi price is ¥35.36, but the driver gets all.\nDidi employs a variety of strategies. Notably, there are multiple service categories, including Discount Express, Express (the standard offering), and Didi Flash and so on. Interestingly, these categories (in pink outlined above) use the same types of vehicles, but they differ in pricing and potentially in queueing mechanisms hence wait-time. This variation in response times offers flexibility for both drivers and passengers to adapt to shifts in supply/demand and corresponding tradeoff between wait times and price.\nSecondly, the process of matching, that is, the selection of drivers who compete for ride requests, is crucial. This aspect provides room for manipulation and can be seen as a big playfield for mechanism design, operations research, and economics. I believe that a significant team within Didi is dedicated to this endeavor. (Perhaps an internship opportunity beckons?)\nLastly, from a long-term perspective, Didi has the capacity to evaluate drivers and assign them \u0026ldquo;scores\u0026rdquo; based on certain metrics, incentivizing them to take on lower-priced services in the early stages to increase overall supply of oneself in a long run. Evidently, Didi has implemented this approach, as drivers who establish fresh accounts prefer fulfilling less lucrative orders to accumulate scores, leading to more profitable ride assignments exceeding ¥100 per trip. Drivers risk penalties if they decline too many low-value orders, which may result in a decreased rate of order allocation from the platform. It is unclear whether this assessment and discrimination mechanism is publicly disclosed to drivers, and even if it were, comprehending and navigating it remains a challenge. This dynamic resembles a repeated, online game, and it may currently be in an unfavorable Nash equilibrium for the drivers.\nOK, back to reality, here\u0026rsquo;s some facts I know and personal experience. Currently, more than 30 smaller platforms vie for a share of the market, attempting to claim a slice of the substantial pie. Didi, as the largest ride-hailing platform in China, maintains a dominant market share, turns a profit (as evidenced by its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange), and wields considerable market influence, albeit without a monopoly. Didi has indeed created employment opportunities and enhanced convenience in my life. Nevertheless, it is imperative to note that ride prices do not consistently translate to cost savings, and drivers contend with the cutthroat competition perpetuated by the platform\u0026rsquo;s voracity, making it increasingly challenging to earn a sustainable income.\nThe fare for my ride last night was ¥44.96, as I distinctly recall. The driver lamented the platform\u0026rsquo;s occasional practice of charging passengers more while remitting a reduced sum to the driver. In jest, I promised to display my fare at the conclusion of the ride when the driver marked the order as \u0026ldquo;completed.\u0026rdquo; On this occasion, the displayed fare was accurate. However, one must bear in mind that it was the dead of night. Had I opted for a traditional taxi, the fare would have been $(12.39 - 3) * 3.6 + 18 = 51.804$, with the entire amount going to the driver. In contrast, the ride-hailing platform\u0026rsquo;s pricing is more competitive, while simultaneously extracting over 30% of the fare. Furthermore, a disconcerting trend emerges as conventional taxi services are compelled to align with ride-hailing platforms in order to augment their customer base, thereby consolidating the platform\u0026rsquo;s market influence and propelling this trajectory towards an unenviable equilibrium.\nI am shocked, I have no word.\n","permalink":"/posts/didi_platform_econ/","summary":"The platform economy is indeed a formidable force, and this assertion is not without merit.\nYesterday, after watching a routine Premier League match featuring Manchester City, I experienced a striking example of the platform economy\u0026rsquo;s impact.

The first section features ceremonial talks, and the second is a more lively discussion of mechanism design, economics, and artificial intelligence.\nSection 1: Ceremonial Talks The first section of the event was filled with what we can affectionately describe as \u0026ldquo;ceremonial talks.\u0026rdquo; These talks are often marked by grand visions and mutual compliments, leaving the audience yearning for more substance. However, there was a beacon of hope in the form of my advisor who is also the director of the lab, managed to infuse genuine content into his speech.\nSection 2: Insights from Mechanism Design, Economics, and AI This is where the meat of the event was. Three scholars presented inspirational talks:\nTalk 1: Jianwei Huang - Data Privacy and Correlation Jianwei Huang, representing CHUK-SZ, delivered a fascinating talk on mechanism design related to data privacy in correlated social network. He delved into questions about aligning individuals\u0026rsquo; willingness to contribute data and the incentives required from data collectors.\nHuang presented a mathematical model that included two crucial layers: the data layer (modelled as a weighted undirected graph) and the social layer (weighted directed graph), with asymmetric characteristics. His insights included the role of conditional variance in individual privacy loss and the trade-off between adding noise and self-interest.\nTalk 2: Xiaole Wu - Endogenous Merger Decisions Among Competitors: Impact of Limiter Capacity and Loyal Segment Professor Xiaole Wu from FDU provided insights on merger decisions restricted with productivity capacity and loyal consumer. It\u0026rsquo;s quite a classical economic-game-theory work. About merger, real-world examples ranged from microchips, to e-commerce, like to the union of Didi and Uber China. Wu used a notion of \u0026ldquo;strong Nash\u0026rdquo; equilibrium (immune to collusions) to analyze merger decisions, emphasizing the importance of capacity constraints. Her analysis illustrated the implications for competition and social welfare, revealing which merger methods could reduce competition.\nBut they\u0026rsquo;re limited to simplified market model involving 3 firms asymmetrically or multiple firm symmetrically. Huh, economists.\nTalk 3: Jirong Wen, Renmin University - Concepts: Intelligent Agent vs. LLM Jirong Wen, representing Renmin University, explored the world of intelligent agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). In his talk, he introduced the notion of a \u0026ldquo;reasoning chain\u0026rdquo; and the more intricate concept of \u0026ldquo;multi-track reasoning chains.\u0026rdquo; These chains form the foundation for understanding the evolution of intelligent agents and their decision-making processes.\nI was in the restroom in the third talk because personally, still not a big fan of LLM. But my friend really liked it so I was like ok sure (and pretending to be appreciating the third talk as well). But the event in general was fruitful and happy.

However, the competition does not translate into commensurate quality but rather inflated prices. This does not align with the typical characteristics of Bertrand competition. A cursory search on Meituan for \u0026ldquo;Tea Houses\u0026rdquo; within a 3-kilometer radius yields approximately 30 results, all claiming to offer authentic Guangdong or Hong Kong flavors. Regrettably, it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say that at least half of these establishments fall far from the mark of excellence.\nAs consumers, we bear the burden of search costs, which accompany every online delivery order or in-person visit to a restaurant. The accumulation of disappointing experiences gradually erodes our expectations. This cycle prompts us to reconsider and wonder, \u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t I stick with my trusted choices?\u0026rdquo; Regret becomes a familiar companion, discouraging us from venturing into culinary experimentation in the future.\nTurning to empirical observations, the top five recommendations on the Meituan App are often denoted as the \u0026ldquo;most popular Tea Houses in the district.\u0026rdquo; However, these establishments exhibit an average meal price ranging from ¥30 to ¥50, a common range within Shanghai but clearly surpassing their production costs. Moreover, the presented price does not encompass the entirety of expenses, as it conceals additional charges under the guises of \u0026ldquo;packaging fees,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;delivery fees,\u0026rdquo; and even supplementary charges for condiments.\nThe price is inflated, food quality barely satisfying but\u0026hellip;packaging is fancy. They are really sabotaging the reputation of Guangdong Cuisine. What a disgrace.\nFor heaven\u0026rsquo;s sake why and where did the excessive revenue go? A substantial portion goes to Meituan\u0026rsquo;s special position in the delivery platform sector. As a market leader with an extensive array of restaurants and consumers, Meituan wields the privilege of determining prices, thereby maximizing its own revenue. The phenomenon of inflated prices is predominantly attributable to Meituan\u0026rsquo;s pursuit of profit, restaurants conforming to the industry\u0026rsquo;s overpackaging practices, and promotional fees. This capital seldom serves to enhance the quality of the food.\nFurthermore, it remains an enigma how low-quality restaurants manage to do sponsor search and elevate their positions in search results. This scenario essentially shapes an all-pay auction wherein participants vie intensely for dominance, leaving consumers to shoulder the consequences.\nMeituan\u0026rsquo;s recommendations to consumers are heavily influenced by individual purchasing and viewing histories, a strategy geared towards augmenting the perceived match value. While this approach aims to minimize search costs and increase engagement on the platform, it inadvertently fosters an environment of culinary homogeneity.\nTaking a broader perspective, Indonesia\u0026rsquo;s decision to segregate social media from online retail through the ban on e-commerce services in TikTok merits recognition. These platforms have skillfully exploited users\u0026rsquo; digital dependencies, ultimately diverting revenue towards themselves. While they may assert an overall enhancement of sales, the microeconomic implications remain, as yet, unsubstantiated.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a topic to be researched, and I\u0026rsquo;ll bet $100 that the answer is negative.

But lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that these tea houses are all cut from the same cloth. They\u0026rsquo;ve got a dodgy business model, throwing heaps of cash at expansion and luring in customers, but somehow forgetting to up their game when it comes to the food.\nIn a way, these Guangdong Tea Houses in Shanghai are kind of like Panda Express in the U.S. or a local McDonald\u0026rsquo;s in China. They\u0026rsquo;re like odd creatures that have sprung up, almost disrespecting the roots of the original cuisine, at least some of them. Let me vent my frustrations to you for a moment.\nFirst off, they\u0026rsquo;re all a bunch of copycats, pretending to be something they\u0026rsquo;re not - authentic Guangdong. They\u0026rsquo;ve got the same tired decor trying to mimic the vibe of 1990s Guangdong with bold fonts, retro designs, and kitschy plates and knick-knacks that seem like they were bought on some budget online store. And in the background, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear the same old Cantonese tunes playing on a loop. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a farce. Real Guangdong restaurants are the result of years of hard work, often run by family businesses where a skilled chef takes the helm for decades. The items that adorn these establishments have been collected over time, menus tend to stay the same for years, reflecting the dedication, choices, time, and history of everyone who built the place - the chef, the waitstaff, and the local community. You can\u0026rsquo;t replicate the genuine Guangdong experience without putting in the effort. Like,\nnow i finally emphasize with at least one BP song, and understand when the economists who claim that market needs regulations. when it\u0026rsquo;s spoiled by fierce competition towards a bad outcome and ruined your favourite cuisine, you want someone to bring things back on track.\nBunch of wannabes that wanna be me.\nWho do you think you are???\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the food - and, to be blunt, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing to write home about. The menus are all cookie-cutter, offering the same ol\u0026rsquo; stuff. You can bet they\u0026rsquo;ve got the standard drinks - Hong Kong milk tea, iced lemon black tea, and the usual suspects. They dish out the same mundane weekday lunch options like Cha-Shao with rice and curry pork rice. And for dessert, it\u0026rsquo;s always the usual suspects like \u0026ldquo;Lou Nai Hua,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026rsquo;leaked milk\u0026rsquo; French toast, pineapple bun with butter, and the like. Some places might add a little twist, but it\u0026rsquo;s essentially the same simple fare that doesn\u0026rsquo;t demand a seasoned chef - made with cheap, storable ingredients. Their beef is frozen, the chicken isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly fresh, and they don\u0026rsquo;t even bother with soups because they require a bit more time and effort. In a nutshell, the menu at these Shanghai-Hong Kong lookalikes is a carefully selected mix of items that are easy to cook and rake in the cash.\nFRUSTRATING.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker. These so-called Tea Houses are sprouting up everywhere, especially near my college in Shanghai, which is like a hub of consumer culture. It\u0026rsquo;s clear that they\u0026rsquo;re spreading like wildfire and trying to take over the Guangdong cuisine market in a sly way.

And we, the customers, have to foot the bill for their flashy ads and ambiance. It\u0026rsquo;s a bad equilibrium when the capital behind those restaurants just want to make money, with excessive demands in a very large and thick consumer-culture poisoned market, crowed majority aiming for acceptable food with a tight budget and sinking demand to lower level buying.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;m spending more on mediocre food and have no better alternatives in sight.

It\u0026rsquo;s as if the artists and producers today haven\u0026rsquo;t received the same rigorous musical training. Simple chord progressions, unchanging beat combinations, and a lack of unique musical design are common. Perhaps, in this era, popular music focuses more on delivering a specific emotional experience rather than pure musical enjoyment. That\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nHowever, Mariah Carey offers something different. I won\u0026rsquo;t pretend that she exists outside of the capitalist music industry bubble. That\u0026rsquo;s impossible.

The live recording was later adapted to create the official music video for the song.\nJust a little bit more about the song. Hero is an Andante, the pace is like someone talking to you gently that you yourself is your own hero - \u0026ldquo;that the hero lies in you\u0026rdquo;. The first two verses are good.

We\u0026rsquo;re both dedicated to research this semester, so our social lives aren\u0026rsquo;t the most active. Consequently, we didn\u0026rsquo;t plan like a grand party a month in advance.\nBut we found ourselves in the same class this morning when my reminder notified me of her birthday. Spontaneously, I suggested going out with a few people for dinner and fun, and she gladly agreed. In the afternoon, we started sending out WeChat DM invitations to our classmates, but it appeared that most of them were busy.\nWell, they surely did have time, at least some of them. I won\u0026rsquo;t say it hurts that much when people politely turned down invitations, but it certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t a very pleasant experience when it happened more than ten times in a row. Some of the people I asked had owed me significant favors in the past. And another even had the audacity to ask, \u0026ldquo;Who else is coming?\u0026rdquo; before turning down the invitation. Wow, assessing the party crowd in such a direct way is so disrespectful.\nBut it happens a lot. When I am being cheerful and genuine while others opt to feign coolness, hesitating with their supposed \u0026ldquo;plans\u0026rdquo; as if they\u0026rsquo;re incredibly busy.

One of the topics they covered was related to Goldin\u0026rsquo;s 2000 research paper, \u0026ldquo;Orchestrating Impartiality: The Impact of \u0026lsquo;Blind\u0026rsquo; Auditions on Female Musicians.\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract A change in the audition procedures of symphony orchestras\u0026ndash;adoption of \u0026ldquo;blind\u0026rdquo; auditions with a \u0026ldquo;screen\u0026rdquo; to conceal the candidate\u0026rsquo;s identity from the jury\u0026ndash;provides a test for sex-biased hiring. Using data from actual auditions, in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases the probability a woman will be advanced and hired. Although some of our estimates have large standard errors and there is one persistent effect in the opposite direction, the weight of the evidence suggests that the blind audition procedure fostered impartiality in hiring and increased the proportion women in symphony orchestras.\nIn the 1970s, symphony orchestras started transitioning to blind auditions, using physical screens during the process to prevent discrimination based on a musician\u0026rsquo;s gender. Substantial evidence shows that this change significantly reduced gender bias in hiring, increasing the likelihood of women passing junior rounds by 50%, and final rounds by several folds.\nPreparing for auditions demands a considerable amount of time and energy, not to mention the associated mental stress and travel expenses. Therefore, the increase in the chances of being hired effectively enhances the odds of the audition process. This improvement motivates female musicians to participate more actively in auditions, making the market more robust and diverse.\nHowever, orchestra work comes with inflexible schedules that involve touring and extensive rehearsals. Consequently, accommodating the need for flexible working hours, particularly for women who may become pregnant, would significantly increase the orchestra\u0026rsquo;s costs due to the necessity of hiring substitutes. So it\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff for the orchestra itself, upon quality of players and their potential future working capacity, as well as reputation, diversity, etc..\n","permalink":"/posts/orchestra_audition/","summary":"I caught some intriguing facts during this morning\u0026rsquo;s breakfast broadcast, where they featured an episode with Claudia Goldin.

Here are some key takeaways:\nThis problem is known as the high level \u0026ldquo;train timetabling problem\u0026rdquo; (TTP) and lower level intermediate \u0026ldquo;train platform problem\u0026rdquo; (TPP). This is not just a profitable business, but a complex issue that affects the welfare of millions of travelers. The primary objectives here are service level, operational cost, safety issue. The challenge lies in the sheer scale of the problem, with huge number of complicated constraints to consider, model and solve, encompassing both the train timetabling problem (TTP) and the train platform problem (TPP). Unlike metro planning, where trains uniformly stop at every station, the complexity of train scheduling arises from the multitude of schedules and train types and the various specific issue related to, well, driving such high-speed vehicle.\nit\u0026rsquo;s like planning your daily schedule. it\u0026rsquo;s OK to test and hypothetically picture exploding the deadlines. but you\u0026rsquo;ll have to get the shits done no matter what\nInterestingly, this morning, I was listening to a podcast about the operational and revenue management of airline companies, and now, in the afternoon, we\u0026rsquo;re delving into trains. It\u0026rsquo;s noteworthy that OR/OM thrive in hyper-scale industries. The less human interest a problem generates and the more mundane it appears, the greater the room for profit through automated optimization.\nNaturally, this problem leads to Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP). One approach to optimization is the Job Shop model, which the schedule in a natural manner, optimizes from the highest level and then sends the schedule to each station to assess feasibility at a more intermediate scale. During this stage, additional low-level constraints are integrated into the system. This algorithm iteratively schedules one train at a time until all more than five hundred trains are accommodated.\nAnother approach is the space-time network model, which discretizes time and space into vertices and examines variables from a different perspective. This offers a more intuitive representation, particularly from a graph theory standpoint, making it easier and more natural to represent the constraints. However, it can become quite challenging when finer time units, such as transitioning from per minute to per second, are required.\nIn this second method, the use of binary variables reusults in explosively large set of constraints, rendering it impossible for any commercial solver to handle efficiently. The trick here involves assigning weights and penalties to violated constraints, effectively transforming the problem into a shortest path problem. Ultimately, a heuristic is employed to approximate a feasible optimal solution. Btw, the heuristic prioritizes faster trains initially and then accommodates slower trains in the schedule.\nIn the high-level Train Timetabling Problem (TTP), the COPT solver efficiently addresses the issue within a mere 20 minutes. When it comes to the intermediate Train Platform Problem (TPP), the solver requires approximately 2 hours to find a solution. However, in the realm of human planning, it takes a dedicated team of experienced planners at least a week to accomplish the same task. This stark contrast in timeframes underscores the remarkable efficiency and effectiveness of automated solvers in handling these complex scheduling challenges.\n","permalink":"/posts/trains/","summary":"just for fun but it turns out to be more than fun. i attended an introductory talk on train scheduling in the neighboring department.

The reason? It requires students to be in the top 10% based on their raw GPA, and I ranked only 2nd out of 18 in my class. Consequently, my scholarship was handed over to someone else who had lower scores but from a larger class.\nIt sucks when ¥8000 slips out of your hands. What frustrates me even more is the flawed grading system. Here\u0026rsquo;s the deal: the selection process for this national scholarship is somewhat distortedly incentivized. First, the top student in our class (yes, that\u0026rsquo;s me) gets a first-tier People\u0026rsquo;s scholarship, determined by a blend of academic scores and other criteria. Then, students from various classes who receive this scholarship is qualified to run for the jackpot - the national scholarship which worth ¥8000, solely based on academic scores, with only three winners out of six competitors.\nSee the trick now? I could have graciously relinquished the first-tier People\u0026rsquo;s scholarship, passing it on to the student in my class who ranked just below me in the general criterion but slightly above me in academic scores, so that he can run for the national scholarship – a sure thing since he outranks me in terms of academic scores and falls within the top 10% criteria. Besides, I could also apply for another sponsored scholarship later in the year, worth approximately ¥6000. (There\u0026rsquo;s a rule that restricts students from applying for more than one major scholarship exceeding ¥5k, excluding the People\u0026rsquo;s scholarship which offers around ¥1k, in a single school year. And one can only receive the highest prize.) Our mutual welfare will be substantially better off. Plus, it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal for me since I secured them all last year; possessing the titles is what matters.\nThe other reason this situation bothers me is that the scholarship has already been made public. Taking it away means someone inside or close to my social zone who happens to know the count of our niche 18-student class, have noticed and explicitly pointed out \u0026ldquo;Hey, she\u0026rsquo;s second in raw academic scores, so she doesn\u0026rsquo;t deserve it – 2 out of 18 is 11%.\u0026rdquo; Hmm, pathetic backstabber.\nThis is a huge setback for me in terms of my personal financing, long story. My family has always been supportive of my education, and they award any money I receive from college, be it scholarships, TA salaries, or competition prizes, tenfold. So the ¥2k gap left by the national scholarship will result ultimately in a loss of over ¥20k. I could have bought another long-focus lens for my Canon.

Episode 2: The Diamond Paradox. I love the paper.\nDiamond\u0026rsquo;s model revolves around a discrete-time market, denoted as $t\\in [T]$, featuring multiple consumers and firms.\nConsumer Behavior Each consumer possesses a downward-sloping demand function $x(p)$, it decreases as price ($p$) increases. In this market, consumers have a strategic buying plan: they purchase a product in period $t$ if and only if the price is less than or equal to their predetermined cutoff price, $q$. Thus, an individual consumer\u0026rsquo;s demand function is defined as: $$ x^*(p) = \\begin{cases} x(p) \u0026amp; \\text{if } p\\leq q \\newline 0 \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nMarket Dynamics In each period, a new pool of consumers enters the market, selects a firm at random, observes the price ($p_t$), and decides whether to buy or wait for the next period. The consumer\u0026rsquo;s utility function is represented as $u(p, z)$, with $z$ indicating the number of periods a consumer is willing to wait. Btw, it\u0026rsquo;s properly regularized, as whatever u might wish it for. Assumptions Here\u0026rsquo;s the fun part, now let\u0026rsquo;s explicitly state the important assumptions made in this model:\nMarket Size and Consumer Behavior: The market is sufficiently large, and consumers are assumed to be somewhat oblivious. This simplifies the model by ignoring memory effects, preference heterogeneity, and the historical impact of price reputation on future demand.\nConsumer Types: consumers can vary among their possible type $h\\in H$ and have different cut-off prices. But their demand curve $x(p)$ is the same. Also, the new pool of consumers entered each period are assumed to be consisted of the same type combination.\nFirm Behavior: Firms are myopically focused on maximizing their utility in the current period and possess perfect knowledge of their demand aggregating function.In each period, firms aim to maximize their objective: $$ \\max_p pX_t(p) = px(p)\\sum_{\\tau}N_t^\\tau (p) $$ $N_t^\\tau(p)$ represents the count of consumers who will make a purchase at price $p$ in period $t$ w.r.t. to their potentially heterogeneous cut-off prices, across different historical generations $\\tau$ and type $h$. It\u0026rsquo;s a proper but shitty definition, leave the mathematical notation alone.\nDenoting $p_t$ as one of the optimal solutions to this decision problem, it can be demonstrated that $\\bar p_t \\le p_t \\le p^*$, with $\\bar p_t$ representing the minimum cutoff price ensuring every consumer purchases the product, under certain assumptions.\nResult - Price Adjustment Moving on, we consider how prices adjust over time. Assume that consumers who persist in the market gradually raise their cutoff prices over time by a constant non-degenerate fraction, such as $q^{h\\tau}_{t + 1} \u0026gt; q^{h \\tau}_t+ \\eta$, where $\\eta \u0026gt; 0$.\nNow, for the tricky part: we posit that for consumers of the same type $h$ across different generations, say, $\\tau = t$ and $\\tau\u0026rsquo; = t + 1$, their cutoff prices are related as follows: $q^{h\\tau}_{t + 1}$ falls between $q_t^{h\\tau}$ and $q^{* h}$, where\n$$u^h(q^{*h}, 1) = u^h(p_t, 2)$$\nso the new generation knows the current period\u0026rsquo;s price $p_t$ and anticipate that firms will maintain similar pricing in the next period. Assume they select a cutoff price that falls within a certain range, satisfying the following condition:\n$$q^{*h}\\le q^{h\\tau\u0026rsquo;}_{t+1}\\le q^{h\\tau}_t$$\nor reversed.\nContinuing from the above, we can establish that if $\\bar p_t \\le p_t$, then $\\bar p_{t+1} \u0026gt; \\bar p_t$. Given our earlier demonstration that $\\bar p_t \\le p_t \\le p^*$, we conclude that the sequence ${\\bar p_{\\tau}}_{\\tau = 1}^\\infty$ converges to $p^*$. This analysis forms a crucial part of our discussion.\nIn a market where consumers anticipate stability with prices like $p^*$ persisting, firms can strategically increment their prices while maintaining demand levels. Sneaky, right? This continues until equilibrium is reached, possibly at a monopoly price if it is initially lower.\nI was going to complain but\u0026hellip; While Diamond\u0026rsquo;s model may seem laden with assumptions, both conservative and unconventional, it has been deliberately crafted to facilitate tractable analysis. It\u0026rsquo;s not surprising that it leads to intriguing paradoxes and\u0026hellip; tons of citations.\nAnyway, they essence of this famously recognized paper (a Nobel-Price winning one after all) is that it modeled market friction as search cost (the cost of waiting in search period) and spurred off subsequent decades of extensive research. Peter Diamond himself also said in his bio\nThe kind of theoretical work I most enjoy is sorting out how to approach a problem to get insights, more so than refining models to shed further light on it. Thus, it was natural for me to explore new areas once I felt I had hit diminishing returns in one area.\nDissatisfaction with (well-understood) analysis was part of the drive that led to this success; trying to get a more satisfactory perspective that would open up the ability to better answer economic questions was another part.\nHear hear.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the key insight:\nYou have 3 werewolves, 3 deities (comprising a seer, a witch, and a hunter), and 3 villagers.\nThe pivotal aspect of this game lies in the fact that the side of good prevails only if 3 werewolves are eliminated while at least 1 deity remains alive. From a broader perspective, it appears that the deities can play a proactive role by openly sharing information, aiding the other players in identifying the wicked faction, and subsequently voting them out. Not exactly though.\nThe most engaging and pivotal phase of the game occurs during the day, where all players take turns speaking briefly. However, they are not allowed to engage in discussions or debates. The moderator decides the speaking order and direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Following this, players vote, collectively deciding on the execution of the player with the most votes. Consequently, the sequence of speaking holds significant importance. Later speakers possess more information and can exploit flaws in the arguments of previous speakers. The early speakers, unfortunately, lack this advantage as they possess minimal information and can only pass or speak honestly about themselves. Later speakers wield greater influence. For instance, a werewolf speaking after the seer could deceitfully claim to be the seer, misleading other players and potentially leading to the seer\u0026rsquo;s wrongful execution.\nTwo key speaking positions are the seer\u0026rsquo;s and the final speaker\u0026rsquo;s. The seer\u0026rsquo;s ability to provide critical information is pivotal for the good side, making the game considerably tougher if the seer is eliminated early without revealing substantial information about the werewolves. On the first day, if the witch still has her \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; potion (indicated by a death on the previous first night), the seer can safely reveal their identity and identify a werewolf. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that werewolves can also impersonate the seer if they speak after the actual seer, or when the seer doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak up.\nThe final speaker\u0026rsquo;s role is significant as they can summarize, reiterate vital information, and potentially influence the outcome through selective statements. However, there can be instances, such as when my brother gets the final speaking slot, where the final speaker can drag on indefinitely for over ten minutes, testing everyone\u0026rsquo;s patience.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss a higher-level strategy. If our objective is to consistently win as a member of the good side, collaboration between the seer and the witch becomes crucial. They should communicate effectively, allowing the witch to poison a suspicious werewolf at night and safeguard the seer, who can then gather more information in subsequent rounds. The hunter, on the other hand, should remain secretive as the \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; deity to secure victory when all the werewolves are eliminated. Occasionally, villagers might choose to impersonate the seer to protect the genuine seer. In general, the key is to act strategically, making optimal decisions and eliminating (or exposing and voting out) anyone obstructing your path to victory.\nHowever, if our objective differs and aims to enjoy a social game without ruthlessly dominating or annoying other players, our focus should shift to entertaining and ensuring that others want to invite us to future gatherings. Winning a reasonable number of rounds is important to avoid being the perpetual loser, but it\u0026rsquo;s equally important not to excel to the extent of intimidating others. Understanding the game, thinking ahead while leaving room for others to contribute their opinions is the way to go. Winning in terms of gameplay might be straightforward, but winning in terms of social dynamics is the real challenge.\n","permalink":"/posts/werewolf2/","summary":"Winning in terms of gameplay might be straightforward, but winning in terms of social dynamics is the real challenge.","title":"a little more about the werewolf game"},{"content":"The Werewolf game is a wildly popular social board game in China, enjoyed by groups of 4 to 10 players. It\u0026rsquo;s a versatile game that can be played in various settings, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a post-meal gathering or any other social occasion. The game has gained immense popularity, transcending friend circles. For instance, our orchestra crew delved into intense games of werewolf in the hotel lobby until the late hours during our tour, while the scientist squads (or actually, professors) engaged in a gripping round when they were unexpectedly confined indoors due to a rainstorm during a conference reception. The game, in both its original form and its various adaptations, has become ubiquitous. You can find the original physical cards, limited-edition golden-plated versions, and even online mini-program software on WeChat, making it accessible even when you don\u0026rsquo;t have the physical cards.\nThe game\u0026rsquo;s popularity can be attributed to three key factors: accessibility, a delicate balance between randomness and strategic elements, and its innate social nature. However, describing its allure without a solid example is challenging. Here\u0026rsquo;s a classic version of the werewolf game:\nParticipants: 9 players + 1 neutral moderator.\nRoles:\n3 werewolves (form the dark side)\nThey mutually decide on a person to kill each night.\n3 deities (aligned with the good side)\nThe seer\nCan investigate the identity of one person (self-selected) every night to determine if they are a werewolf.\nThe witch\nPossesses two potions, one to save a person and one to poison a person. The witch can use these potions at her discretion.\nThe hunter\nCan kill one person when he himself is killed.\n3 villagers (aligned with the good side)\nAt the beginning of the game, each player receives a random role, knowing their own but unaware of the others.\nThe game proceeds with alternating night and day rounds. Typically, during the night, werewolves choose a victim, while during the day, players converse, exchange information, and vote to execute one player.\nThe objective for each player is to secure a victory for their side. The good side wins if all the werewolves are eliminated and at least one deity survives; otherwise, the dark side prevails. The detailed rules of the game can be expressed as follows in pseudocode:\nwhile NO_SIDE_WINS: -\u0026gt; Night Routine: The moderator announces, \u0026#34;Everyone, close your eyes; night falls.\u0026#34; - Werewolves choose their nightly victim. - (IF seer is alive) The seer investigates one person\u0026#39;s identity. - (IF witch is alive) The witch can exercise her powers: - IF the witch still has her \u0026#34;save\u0026#34; potion: The witch is informed of the werewolves\u0026#39; victim for the night. - IF it\u0026#39;s the \u0026#34;first night,\u0026#34; the witch can use the potion on anyone, including herself. ELSE the witch can save anyone with her \u0026#34;save\u0026#34; potion, except herself. - IF the witch still has her \u0026#34;kill\u0026#34; potion, the witch can choose to eliminate one person. - (IF hunter is alive) The hunter is informed of their living status. --\u0026gt; Day Routine: The moderator announces, \u0026#34;The day has arrived; everyone, open your eyes,\u0026#34; and reveals who was killed during the night. - IF it\u0026#39;s the first night: Deceased players can provide a \u0026#34;testament\u0026#34; to provide additional information if desired. ELSE, in subsequent nights, deceased players cannot speak in their testament. - The moderator designates the first person to speak and the direction (clockwise/counter-clockwise) for players to share information. - At the day\u0026#39;s end, players vote (secretly, without knowledge of others\u0026#39; votes) for the most suspicious player to identify the werewolves. - The player with the most votes is executed. The game typically spans multiple rounds, often lasting 3-4 nights and days. The seer plays a pivotal role, and the witch possesses significant power. What makes the game truly entertaining is the opportunity for players to bluff, deceive, and reveal their alternate personalities, sometimes displaying a hint of aggression. Furthermore, the social aspect of the game shines when players integrate their knowledge of each other from \u0026ldquo;out-of-game\u0026rdquo; interactions into the gameplay. In other words, taking it personal.\nFor instance, in larger groups, an additional deity, \u0026ldquo;Cupid,\u0026rdquo; may be introduced. Cupid links two players as a couple in the first round, creating a third faction. This faction wins if all other factions are eliminated. In close-knit friend groups, romantic feelings and friendships may emerge, adding a layer of complexity and humor to the game. The chemistry between linked couples and the banter that ensues when people make jokes and guesses further heightens the enjoyment.\nHowever, the game\u0026rsquo;s social nature also has its drawbacks. At times, it can lead to an excess of repetitive and shallow conversations. While the delicate balance between randomness and strategic thinking initially adds excitement and relaxation to the game, it can become monotonous after several rounds. Additionally, the social aspect sometimes comes with preconceived notions about players\u0026rsquo; characteristics. This can lead to unfortunate discrimination, where individuals like my brilliant cousin often find themselves targeted and executed in the early rounds, potentially leading to a repetitive and less engaging experience.\nmy friend invited me to play a special werewolf game in a boardgame house, on the day of the beautiful mid-autumn festival, playing a special moonlight edition.\nTo solve this problem, in contrast, there\u0026rsquo;s another variant known as \u0026ldquo;One-Night\u0026rdquo; Werewolf. Unlike the multi-round format where players are eliminated, this version consists of a single round where no one is eliminated. Instead, players swap, match, and attempt to deduce their identities. The one-night werewolf game is fast-paced and demands sharper strategic deductions, making it a thrilling alternative. My advisor is particularly passionate about this version.

The Nobel Prize announcement is approaching, slated for October 2nd to 9th, with one laureate revealed each day. And the Ballon d\u0026rsquo;Or (the prestigious Golden Ball award for footballers) is set for October 30. Juicy October! It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be fun.\nSpeaking of the Ballon d\u0026rsquo;Or, it\u0026rsquo;s organized by the French Football magazine. From 2010 to 2015, FIFA and French Football collaborated on this award, but their partnership ended in 2015 when FIFA introduced its own \u0026ldquo;The Best FIFA Football Awards\u0026rdquo; later in 2017. Despite the name distinction, both awards essentially honor the \u0026ldquo;Best Player of the Year\u0026rdquo; for the season. Typically, it\u0026rsquo;s a duopoly of the football legends CR7 and Messi, occasionally interrupted by other renowned names like Benzema and Modrić.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into the intriguing nomination and award process, focusing on the years 2010-2015. Initially, French Football and FIFA jointly compile a shortlist of 30 players, which is unveiled in early September. Subsequently, a diverse panel of over 100 individuals, including national team captains, coaches, and journalists, is invited to cast their votes. They rank their top three players, with the first choice earning 5 points, the second 3 points, and the third 1 point. The player with the most points wins the award, which is announced during the October ceremony.\nNavigating this process may seem complex. At least the voting mechanism doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem straightforwardly truthful to me. But if the ultimate goal is to determine the very top player, the voting process should yield the desired outcome with large possibility\u0026hellip;right? Moreover, though the Ballon d\u0026rsquo;Or typically goes to the best and most popular player on the planet for that year — but everyone nominated is already deserving for being in the shortlist.\nNobody is \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; Leo Messi, except for Mr. Martinez (at least in this epic world cup victory shot)\u0026hellip; Btw, Lautaro Martinez is also in 2023\u0026rsquo;s Ballon d\u0026rsquo;Or shortlist.\nThe good news is that FIFA provides detailed voting results, revealing to the extent of who voted for whom and in what order.

So, here\u0026rsquo;s another conversation series. It happened years ago during one of my flute lessons with my teacher:\n(Practicing one of Pierre Sancan\u0026rsquo;s sonatines)\nMe: These modern French pieces are literally weird.\nMr. Chou: No they\u0026rsquo;re fine. The one I chose for you is already one of the best from that era\u0026rsquo;s works. You should go and listen to some other modern composers, and you\u0026rsquo;ll realize how wonderful this music can be (compared to them).\nMe: So, when you were in Paris, did you explore all of them, the good the bad and the worst ones?\nHim: Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s part of the journey. When you\u0026rsquo;re trained as a professional musician, you learn both the classics and the contemporary music. We even have specific exams for, like, studying and performing novel pieces—freshly composed by some unknown names, they\u0026rsquo;re all brilliantly crazy creative minds. Since they\u0026rsquo;re new, there\u0026rsquo;s often no established interpretation, so we must personally decipher and make sense of the artistic interpretation.\nMe: Even though most of them can be terrible? I don\u0026rsquo;t get it. In terms of efficiency of studying or even for enjoyment, you could have just focused on the best classical pieces by Beethoven or Mozart that have stood the test of time. Why bother with those modern compositions where nine out of ten are, well, terrible?\nHim: But one out of those ten attempts, or sometimes even one out of hundreds or thousands of those experimental pieces, can be revolutionary and become the classic piece after decades or centuries. Beethoven was also an innovator for his time. Probably people of his era thought his music was rebellious and maybe even bad. That\u0026rsquo;s how it works. You might only see the perfectly selected pieces that have endured, out of countless failed attempts. But that\u0026rsquo;s why they\u0026rsquo;re called classics.\nMe: So, should I be grateful for having the opportunity to hear and practice these completely eccentric and unconventional compositions because we\u0026rsquo;re on the cutting edge of, the next generation of music?\nHim: Nope\u0026hellip;as I mentioned earlier, I\u0026rsquo;ve already chosen the best ones for you. Plus, 20th-century French composers are hardly considered contemporary. Now that you\u0026rsquo;re interested, I\u0026rsquo;ll introduce you to another post-modern composer next week, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be amazed by the real experimentation.\nAnd I was like NOOOOOOOOOOO I\u0026rsquo;d rather do another Bach. And he hoped I can be amazed by it? It was more of utterly perplexed and shocked back then.\nAs it turns out, it takes time, well, actually years, to build up a lot more maturity and experience so as to fully grasp the delicacy, depth, and beauty of those music.\n","permalink":"/posts/la_la_land/","summary":"Another conversation, from one of my early flute lessons.","title":"conversation"},{"content":"Following yesterday\u0026rsquo;s post, as promised, here\u0026rsquo;s an analysis of the proposed model in the series of papers.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll focus on a few key parameters: $\\mu$ (product heterogeneity factor, which multiplies the i.i.d. random parameter $\\epsilon$ to yield the product\u0026rsquo;s net value for a consumer), search cost $c$, and market size $n$ (the number of firms). Consumer count $L$ is irrelevant because we\u0026rsquo;re examining expected revenue with i.i.d. consumers, and it\u0026rsquo;s simply a constant multiplier.\nBuilding upon our previous discussion, assuming a symmetric equilibrium, where all firms share the same equilibrium price, denoted as $p^{\\star}$. Consumer search behavior is akin to Pandora\u0026rsquo;s box: for a consumer holding her current best option $v_i = \\mu\\epsilon_i$ found at firm $i$, which sets the price at $p_i$. If she continues searching, her expected incremental value becomes:\n$$ G_\\mu(\\epsilon_i, p_i) =\\int_\\R[\\mu\\epsilon - p^{\\star}-( \\mu\\epsilon_i - p_i)]^+\\ dF(\\epsilon) $$ When $G_\\mu(\\epsilon_i, p_i) - c \\geq 0$, it incentivizes the consumer to keep searching for a potentially better product. Notably, $G_\\mu$ decreases as $\\mu\\epsilon_i - p_i$ decreases, so we find a critical value $\\hat u$ where, for any $\\epsilon_i$ and $p_i$ satisfying $\\mu \\hat\\epsilon_i - \\hat p_i \\geq \\hat u$, the consumer continues searching. Otherwise, she stops and buys if her utility remains positive.\nFor the firm $i$, if he sneakily sets his price at $p_i$ (so while consumer search they still assume $p^{\\star}$ for every firms, only accepting $p_i$ after they searched company $i$), his demand would be\n$$ D(p_i, p_{-i}^{\\star}) = \\sum_{t = 1}^{n} \\frac{1}n F^{t-1}(\\hat \\epsilon^{\\star})(1 - F(\\hat \\epsilon_i)) + \\int_{\\max(a, p_i)}^{\\hat \\epsilon_i} F^{n-1}(\\epsilon_i - (p^{\\star} - p_i)/\\mu)\\ dF(\\epsilon_i) $$ The first component sums the expectation of consumers (selecting firms randomly) who search until they reach $i$ without encountering a satisfying product before $\\mu\\epsilon_i - p_i \\geq \\hat u_i$ and then make a purchase. The second component represents consumers who search all firms without finding a satisfying product, eventually returning to buy from firm $i$, where they find the best option.\nRevenue is simply $p_i \\times D$. WLOG assume under equilibrium that $p^{\\star} \\leq a$, and a necessary condition for symmetric equilibrium is $$ \\partial_{p_i}\\pi(p^{\\star}, p_{-i}^{\\star}) = 0\\Rightarrow p^{\\star} = -D(p^{\\star}, p_{-i}^{\\star})/\\partial_{p_i}D(p^{\\star}, p_{-i}^{\\star}). $$ With tributes to my OCD: $$ p^{\\star}=\\frac{\\mu}{n}\\frac1{\\frac1nf(\\hat\\epsilon^{\\star})(\\frac{1 - F^n(\\hat\\epsilon^{\\star})}{1 - F(\\hat\\epsilon^{\\star})}) - F^{n-1}(\\hat\\epsilon^{\\star})f(\\hat \\epsilon^{\\star}) + \\int_a^{\\hat \\epsilon^{\\star}}(n-1)F^{n-1} (\\epsilon_i)f^2(\\epsilon_i)\\ d\\epsilon_i} $$ recall that $\\mu \\hat \\epsilon^{\\star} - p^{\\star} = \\hat u$ where $\\hat u$ is the critical utility level that originated out of $F$. This equation represents a stability point function that solves the symmetric market equilibrium price, $p^{\\star}$.\nFor economists, the next steps involve the riveting adventure of diving into the abyss of taking limits to scrutinize extreme cases (yawn\u0026hellip;) and studying social welfare (like figuring out the optimal market size (aka $n$) based on the delicate balance between welfare and search costs) and tracking the trend dynamic of price, revenue, or market size with respect to various parameters.\nNow, from my humble perspective, delving into what happens when $\\mu \\to 0$ feels like chasing after the world\u0026rsquo;s tiniest unicorn because, well, that\u0026rsquo;s when all products become clones of each other. Plus, $c$ and $\\mu$ seem to be, redundant if normalize one of them w.r.t. another. Correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m wrong.\nBut say, fix search cost $c$, when product heterogeneity (or simply, it\u0026rsquo;s just the variance scale of the value distribution\u0026hellip;) $\\mu$ goes from some lower bound $\\mu_0$ (that minimum product variation that incentivize search-then-buy) to sufficiently large, the price and market size in equilibrium would be interesting result to look into (I vaguely recall it\u0026rsquo;s like a dip and then a rise\u0026hellip;or something like that?). It will be fascinating to read the rest of the paper in detail but quite a mental marathon.\nStay tuned for more, possibly tomorrow.

All consumers are unit demand and can choose to either buy/no-buy and quit or continue searching. Consumer\u0026rsquo;s overall utility in a buying process is $$ u_{li}(p_i) -kc, \\text{ searched }k \\text{ times} $$ Firms sought to maximize their sales revenue, i.e. denote $D(p_i, p_{-i})$ as the demand of firm $i$ (if, in this chaotic market, such a well-defined demand even exists), its revenue can simple be found as $p_i D(p_i, p_{-i})$.

The priming effect refers to the positive or negative effect of a rapidly presented stimulus (priming stimulus) on the processing of a second stimulus (target stimulus) that appears shortly after. Generally speaking, the generation of priming effect depends on the existence of some positive or negative relationship between priming and target stimuli.\nWikipeadia\nToday\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Bias and Wisdom in Decision Making\u0026rdquo; class delved into the concept of priming effects. Essentially, we navigated through intricate psychological experiments that adeptly bamboozled participants, employing cunning maneuvers to manipulate their decisions and behaviors. Unlike economic experiments, where participants are forthrightly apprised of the experiment settings, these psychological experiments artfully duped participants, employing diversions to nudge them into exhibiting the desired behaviors.\nFor instance, one experiment devised a scenario in which participants ultimately had to decide (and comment upon) whether they\u0026rsquo;d hire a fellow named Steve. Steve was merely a \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo; individual who coincidentally shared an elevator ride with the participant, entrusting them with the task of holding a cup of coffee. Surprisingly, clutching a hot cappuccino for Steve yielded significantly more favorable comments than the ice americano control group.\nTricky. The veracity of these seemingly enchanting phenomena is questionable, whether they truly stem from genuine causation or merely emerge from tenuous correlations or shrewd experimental designs. Ironically, a section on \u0026ldquo;replicability controversy\u0026rdquo; can be found in its Wikipedia page:\nDaniel Kahneman has called on priming researchers to check the robustness of their findings in an open letter to the community, claiming that priming has become a \u0026ldquo;poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research.\u0026rdquo;\nIn 2022, Kahneman described behavioral priming research as \u0026ldquo;effectively dead\u0026rdquo;. (wow, this is a strong claim btw) Other critics have asserted that priming studies suffer from major publication bias, experimenter effect and that criticism of the field is not dealt with constructively.\nKahneman\u0026rsquo;s stance is understandable, considering his dual expertise in psychology and economics. From an economist\u0026rsquo;s vantage point, theories should exhibit a level of abstraction that facilitates broader applicability and predictive capability. Yet, psychology experiments are deeply contingent on the art of framing. Discrepancies in methodology and the way both disciplines embrace their theories inevitably lead to discord.\nAlthough the outcomes might face resistance within the discerning economic community, there\u0026rsquo;s no denying that priming effects and these behavioral stratagems wield substantial and potentially far-reaching economic influence. Supermarkets, for instance, strategically position their delectable bakery sections at the outset of the shopping journey, and indisputably, this maneuver boosts overall revenue. Psychological research asserts that adopting a confident, \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; posture can enhance cognitive self-assurance and positively impact performance, like increasing the score of a subsequent job interview. Economists may wave it off as nonsense, unquantifiable even in the most rudimentary terms of behavioral economics, but the efficacy is undeniable and occasionally transformative.\nNot everything can be neatly confined within the rigid spectrum of demand, supply, and utility. Thinking about these phenomenons just for fun is enjoyable. Yet, sometimes it irks me when certain individuals haphazardly extrapolate these experimental findings and carelessly draw analogue conclusions into other common sense scenarios. These casual deductions are disgusting. So, in terms of research, I gotta be honest, a more rigorous economic perspective is more preferable.\n","permalink":"/posts/priming/","summary":"Not everything can be pigeonholed into the polarized spectrum of demand, supply, and utility.

Remember that time I went on a rubbishing about authors skipping proofs and trivializing everything.

But it\u0026rsquo;s tolerable, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen far worse.\nHim: Perhaps he believes it\u0026rsquo;s already detailed enough in terms of math deductions\u0026hellip;\nAnyway. I managed to crack it (after enduring the most dreadful gym session). It\u0026rsquo;s an analysis of a tweaked greedy algorithm for an auction designed to cater to value maximizers (compared to common utility maximizers), who also comes with budget and RoS constraints.\nThe paper establishes that Algorithm 3 has an approximation ratio of $1/6$ w.r.t. the optimal allocation $\\mathbf x$ that maximizes revenue. Denote $\\mathbf x$ and $\\mathbf x^*$ as the allocations for Algorithm 3 and the optimal solution, respectively. There\u0026rsquo;s a step that needs to prove $$ \\sum_{i\\in A}x_{ij}^*w_{ij}\\le \\sum_{i\\in [n]}x_{ij}^*w_{ij}\\le 2W_j(\\mathbf x) $$ where $W_j(x):=\\sum_{i\\in [n]} p_{ij}$ is the revenue earned from object $j$, and $A\\subset [n]$ is, well, some subset of agent set $[n]$. The author just claimed the above \u0026ldquo;due to the greedy property of the algorithm\u0026rdquo;. Cause the algorithm itself is not a classical greedy, so I thought \u0026ldquo;hmmm, not necessarily does it hold\u0026rdquo;. (all without a hint of complaint!) But it turns out that this is just trivial, since $w_{ij}$ is chosen greedily, and some property of $A$ guarantees that $\\sum_i x_{ij}\\ge \\frac12$, the result holds naturally.\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m revisiting the paper tonight, it seems that the author actually spelled out this idea clearly in the paper. Sorry\u0026hellip; my bad. Overall it\u0026rsquo;s a smooth paper to read. The math is elegant and, I would dare say, beautiful.

And why did you marry that person?\u0026rdquo; These are questions that economists and many scholars in various disciplines care about, all the time through history til now. They approach these questions from different perspectives, analyzing them using various statistical techniques and methodologies. While these questions are often addressed in the literature (at least according to the search results on Google Scholar), if you were to ask a specific married couple, whether they are happy or not, they would find it difficult to provide an instant, definite answer.\nAbove all these marriage questions, there\u0026rsquo;s a frequently mentioned notion called \u0026ldquo;assortative matching\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a basic academic terms, which Britannica defines as:\nAssortative mating, in human genetics, a form of nonrandom mating in which pair bonds are established on the basis of phenotype (observable characteristics). For example, a person may choose a mate according to religious, cultural, or ethnic preferences, professional interests, or physical traits.\nPause. It\u0026rsquo;s a little too tricky a definition. It is basically describing a phenomenon where married couples tend to be more similar to each other than to random individuals. But the term \u0026ldquo;more similar is quite vague. A better way to comprehend this concept is by considering a higher degree of similarity within a married couple compared to their feasible mating set. Wildly speaking, for all men $M$ and women $W$, denote $\\text{sim}(m, w)$ for $\\forall m\\in M, w\\in W$ as the \u0026ldquo;homogeneity rate\u0026rdquo; between them. In the context of assortative mating, a couple $(m, w)$ should exhibit a higher $\\text{sim}(m, w)$ not only in comparison to global alternatives but also within their local feasible set of potential partners. This is because we optimize our choice of spouse for economic gains and emotional compatibility (maybe in an \u0026ldquo;online\u0026rdquo; flavour, for you usually can\u0026rsquo;t marry your ex-boy/girlfriend after breaking up with them). Nonetheless, mating itself is already nonrandom and confined to our local feasible set of choices. Therefore, ex-post-ly comparing the similarity rate between a marriage couple and their global average would be unfair. It makes more sense to restrict the comparison of \u0026ldquo;similarity\u0026rdquo; to the feasible set of potential mates.\nNevertheless, this phenomenon is real, people recognize it, with loads of economists trying to understand it\u0026hellip; BUT every now and then we seem to be, actually, leaning towards this arrangement. So, instead of arguing over the casuality of assortative mating and its social welfare inequality implications, there would be more fun in studies that examine whether couples would be better off if they had a certain level of heterogeneity in their phenotypes. More ambitiously, it would be intriguing to investigate whether there exists an optimal pattern of similarity for couples, in terms of their happiness and welfare after marriage. Furthermore, can we find better measures of such heterogeneity than Shannon entropy? (Yeah Shannon entropy is a reliable metric, but please\u0026hellip;anything more engaging, perhaps?) These questions can be explored from an individual perspective and beyond.\nHowever, from a casual perspective, attempting to categorize or pinpoint the causes or effects of assortative matching can be a challenging task, especially when using economic methodology. Basic economic principles assume that people are rational to some extent and act as (general) utility maximizers when making decisions. However, as Shakespeare pointed out over six hundred years ago in \u0026ldquo;A Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream\u0026rdquo;:\nLove looks not with the eyes but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\nLove and attraction often defy rationality, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to apply strict economic principles to matters of the heart.\n","permalink":"/posts/dating/","summary":"the definition of assortative matching is tricky. here\u0026rsquo;s a better one.","title":"assortative mating? hmm"},{"content":"So, I made this epic promise to Al Roth while asking him to sign his book \u0026ldquo;Two-Sided Matching (1990)\u0026rdquo;, that I\u0026rsquo;ll dive in and finish reading it in a blistering four months (spanning this semester). Fast forward, and a quarter of that time has slipped through my fingers, leaving me stranded on page 40 out of 260. Well\u0026hellip;careful with your promises.\nTime to step on the gas pedal. But hey, I found some inspiration in Chapter 2, section 2.3, courtesy of the lattice theorem. It relates to a song of Ariana Grande (the title). Not trying to sabotage anybody\u0026rsquo;s relationship though. Here\u0026rsquo;s the math:\nBackground check: stable matching. Consider a prom, with boys and girls labelled as $M:={m_1, m_2, \u0026hellip;, m_{k_m}}$ and $W:={w_1, w_2, \u0026hellip;, w_{k_w}}$. Naturally, for any $m\\in M$ [$w\\in W$] he [she] would have a preference over any two girls [boys] $w, w\u0026rsquo;\\in W$ [$m, m\u0026rsquo;\\in M$]. Denote this pairwise preference order as $w\\succeq_m w\u0026rsquo;$ [$m\\succeq_w m\u0026rsquo;$]. Assume that it\u0026rsquo;s acyclic and strict (yeah i know this is nontrivial in certain sense, bite me). And we\u0026rsquo;re allowing everyone to rank themselves above a few others. So, for instance, a boy $m\\in M$, might have a preference list that looks something like this:\n$$ P(m):w_1 \\succ w_3 \\succ m \\succ w_2 $$ indicating that $m$ adores $w_1$, maybe she\u0026rsquo;s his crush. $w_3$ isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad, but she\u0026rsquo;s got a bit of an attitude, so she\u0026rsquo;s his second choice. Finally, $w_2$? Too nerdy. He\u0026rsquo;d rather attend prom solo than with her.\nNow, this prom drama (or generally, a bilateral matching market $(M, W, P)$) needs a \u0026ldquo;match\u0026rdquo;. A matching $\\mu$ is a mapping from $M\\cup W$ to $M\\cup W$. For it to be proper, it needs to satisfy two criteria: (i) boys are matched to girls (and vice versa), i.e., $\\mu(m)\\in W\\cup{m}$ and (ii) it\u0026rsquo;s a one-to-one matching, i.e., $\\mu(m) = w$ iff. $\\mu(w) = m$.\nBut then, a meddling teacher enters the scene, acting as a matchmaker, trying to pair everyone up instead of letting the market handle its own romantic affairs. Now, this teacher has to find a stable matching—a matching where there is no blocking pair $(m, w)$ that is not matched but both prefer each other than their current matches.\nBtw, Ariana Grande is an expert in this, as she sings in one of her hit single break up with your girlfriend, i\u0026rsquo;m bored:\nThen I realize she\u0026rsquo;s right there, and I\u0026rsquo;m at home like, \u0026ldquo;Damn, this ain\u0026rsquo;t fair\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd you realize she\u0026rsquo;s right there, and you\u0026rsquo;re at home like \u0026ldquo;Damn, she can\u0026rsquo;t compare.\u0026rdquo;\nChill. In a bilateral matching market, it\u0026rsquo;s been proven that a stable matching always exists. Denote the set of all possible stable matchings as $\\mathcal S$, $\\mathcal S\\ne \\empty$.\nNow, the fun part comes in. There can be multiple possible stable matchings. But which one\u0026rsquo;s better? We can define a partial order on the space $\\mathcal S$, based on all the girls\u0026rsquo; preferences. Given two stable matches, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, we say $\\mu_1 \\succ_W \\mu_2$ if all the girls like $\\mu_1$ as much as $\\mu_2$, with at least some of them stricly preferring $\\mu_1$ over $\\mu_2$. I.e. $\\mu_1\\succ_W \\mu_2 \\text{ if and only if:}$ $$ \\mu_1(w)\\succeq_w \\mu_2(w),\\forall w\\in W\\newline \\mu_1(w)\\succ_w \\mu_2(w),\\exists w\\in W $$ The same partial order can be set up w.r.t. boys. But say, the teacher is a bit biased and favors the girls. She has two stable matches, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ in her hands. Now, if $\\mu_1\\succ_W \\mu_2$, she can just choose $\\mu_1$ over $\\mu_2$. But what if $\\mu_1$ is incomparable to $\\mu_2$ w.r.t. girls, i.e. some girls prefer $\\mu_1$ while others prefer $\\mu_2$? In this case, we merge the two stable matching $\\mu_1, \\mu_2$ that we have in favours of the girls.\nFormally, define $\\lambda := \\mu_1 \\vee_W \\mu_2$ where $$ \\lambda (w) = \\mu_1(w)\\text{, if } \\mu_1(w)\\succeq_w\\mu_2(w)\\text{ and vice versa}\\newline \\lambda (m) = \\mu_1(m)\\text{, if } \\mu_1(m)\\preceq_m\\mu_2(m)\\text{ and vice versa} $$ Notice that the operation $\\vee_W$ leans towards the girls. Moreover, it can be proved that $\\lambda$ is also a stable matching. And all the girls are happier with $\\lambda$, i.e. $\\lambda\\succ_W \\mu_1$ and $\\lambda\\succ_W \\mu_2$.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the solution, the teacher starts with some stable matching $\\mu\\in \\mathcal S$ at hand and start looking for other stable matchings $\\mu\u0026rsquo;\\in \\mathcal S$ and update $\\mu = \\mu\u0026rsquo; \\vee_W\\mu$. Since $\\mathcal S$ is finite, she will eventually land at a $W$-optimal matching $\\mu^*$ which is best for all girls while worst for all boys. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that the saying \u0026ldquo;worst for all boys\u0026rdquo; is a nontrivial statement, but can be proven starting from the observation that $\\lambda $ is worse for all boys than $\\mu_1$ or $\\mu_2$.\nHow I wish I\u0026rsquo;d learned this theory in high school!\n","permalink":"/posts/break_up_with_your_girlfriend/","summary":"about stable matching","title":"break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored"},{"content":" Disclaimer: While I have some knowledge about kidney donation and transplants, I acknowledge that there might be errors in the information presented.

It reflects significant progress in organ transplantation in our country, which is truly admirable. The report states:\nA total of 19449 organ transplants have been performed nationwide in 2019, including 6170 liver transplants and 12124 kidney transplants.\nEven more exciting is the central role that my hometown, Guangzhou, plays in the field of transplantation throughout China. This discovery came as quite a surprise to me. While I was aware of Guangzhou\u0026rsquo;s excellent medical infrastructure, I had always assumed Shanghai would be the pioneer in this area. Nevertheless, congratulations to my hometown!\n(The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, where a lot of the transplantation took place, is one of the most recognized academic medical centers in China.)\nI aspire to pursue a future in healthcare market design.

This morning, I was wolfing down breakfast while simultaneously listening to a podcast, attempting to tackle a mountain of unread messages, and planning for the upcoming week.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s truly fascinating is how our supposedly rational thinking often leads us to irrational behavior. There\u0026rsquo;s definitely something between perfectly rational Homo economicus and the complete naïve irrationals - the thinking-we\u0026rsquo;re-rational-but-actually-aren\u0026rsquo;t Homo minimeconomicus.\nToday, Ms. Homo-minimeconomicus is feeling regretful in an irrational way. I have two go-to podcast series: Freakonomics by Stephen J. Dubner and Jumao Football. Every morning, I randomly select a historical episode based on the title\u0026rsquo;s potential interest or informativeness—more precisely, the best available approximate optimization result w.r.t. to the titles. My entire morning\u0026rsquo;s mood hinges on this random selection process.\nThis morning, I chose an episode from Jumbo Football titled \u0026ldquo;Chatting with Burger Football Diary about the Culture of Football Jersey and Chinese Football.\u0026rdquo; The first bias crept in when I saw the word \u0026ldquo;Jersey\u0026rdquo;— it is a subject of interest to me. However, I blissfully ignored other aspects of the title, such as \u0026ldquo;Chinese Football,\u0026rdquo; which might have hinted that the podcast wasn\u0026rsquo;t as enticing as my initial focus on \u0026ldquo;Jersey\u0026rdquo; led me to believe. Thus, I selectively processed information, filtering out any potentially negative details and updating my beliefs solely based on the positive.\nThe episode turned out to be disappointing. In other words, it didn\u0026rsquo;t meet my expectations in terms of content and quality. It\u0026rsquo;s not to say it was bad, but it certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t live up to my prior beliefs about these podcasts. I may have unintentionally mixed the two series, creating an unfair composite estimate (Freakonomics is undoubtedly more professional than Jumao Football) and overly optimistic expectations.\nAh, the endowment effect.\nRegardless, let\u0026rsquo;s return to jerseys and football culture. The football-jersey podcast episode unfolded as follows: The first 20 minutes were dominated by a verbose self-introduction from the guest speaker—how he started his Bilibili channel about football jerseys and named it after his dog. From a public speaking perspective, he could have done better in capturing his audience\u0026rsquo;s interest and being less self-centered. The next half-hour consisted of an unbroken, casual conversation about how fans should approach buying football jerseys, laden with anecdotal stories rather than statistical analysis. Given that both speakers are long-time dedicated football fans, they displayed a hint of condescension towards \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo; fans who are less committed and more fickle. The last 15 minutes were a mixture of complaints and unstructured opinions about Chinese football clubs and the national team. It felt somewhat spontaneous, and I wished they had prepared with more solid content.\nNonetheless, the podcast did offer some value. It touched upon the contract models between football teams and jersey sponsors, like Nike\u0026rsquo;s support for Real Madrid. There are various forms of contracts, with the most common being individual agreements between sport brands and teams. The alternative is a \u0026ldquo;bundled\u0026rdquo; approach, as seen with Adidas sponsoring all MLS teams. In the speaker\u0026rsquo;s view, individual contracts are preferable as they incentivize teams to perform better and encourage sport brands to offer superior design and quality for jersey kits. In contrast, bundled sponsorships tend to unfairly shift resources and profits from lower-ranked teams to the top ones. This perspective makes sense.\nIn my pov, football jerseys (and sports jerseys in general) represent more than mere additions to a fan\u0026rsquo;s wardrobe. They serve as explicit bonds between fans and their clubs, symbolizing both the team and its players. From a business perspective, jerseys are products shaped by the team\u0026rsquo;s image and the strategic maneuvers of their advertising team in collaboration with sponsors and in competition with other teams.\ni have to admit, despite being a Man City fan, the 23/24 seaeson\u0026rsquo;s Manchester United jersey campaign is epic.\nPersonally, not a big fan of Chinese men\u0026rsquo;s football\u0026hellip; u know the reason. Nevertheless, it\u0026rsquo;s intriguing to delve into the workings of the lower-market teams, instead of exclusively focusing on the top European teams (and Inter Miami). But let\u0026rsquo;s admit that despite all the debates about fabric technology, jersey design, sponsors, so on an so forth, the first thing that comes to mind when mentioning football jerseys is the unacceptably ugly yet ubiquitously famous FC Barcelona\u0026rsquo;s purple-and-red striped shirt, seen everywhere, with the names of Messi, Neymar, or Suarez.\n","permalink":"/posts/literally_bullshit/","summary":"Jerseys serve as explicit bonds between fans and their clubs, symbolizing both the team and its players.

Today, I had lunch with a friend, and once again, our conversation veered towards graduate school admissions. She hails from a different university and is currently a first-year master\u0026rsquo;s student. When girls get together, gossip flows, and this time, she shared her admission experience.\nXXXL Xiao Long Bao. Strongly recommend it.\nUniversities are categorized into tiers: the renowned 985 and 211, the Double First-Class Colleges, and those without any specific title. These rankings are hierarchical. Generally, it\u0026rsquo;s believed that a university with the \u0026ldquo;985\u0026rdquo; title trumps a \u0026ldquo;211\u0026rdquo; university without it. Next come the Double First-Class Colleges, which lack the 985 and 211 titles, and finally, the \u0026ldquo;no-title\u0026rdquo; colleges. When applying to graduate schools, students often aim to climb the title hierarchy, attempting to move from a 211 to a 985 institution.\nUniversities have the liberty to set their own admission criteria for graduate programs. They strategize by organizing summer camps simultaneously with competing universities or by discriminating based on the student\u0026rsquo;s undergraduate degree\u0026rsquo;s title—whether it\u0026rsquo;s from a 985 or, perhaps, a no-title institution.\nAccording to my friend, who comes from a no-title institution but gained admission to a 211 university, it\u0026rsquo;s common knowledge that different universities have distinctive admission styles that vary in terms of discrimination. Furthermore, these styles tend to be consistent and can be discerned by examining past admission data or relying on anecdotes shared among students.\nIn essence, universities commit to certain admission strategies, and these strategies are known to applicants. For instance, during our conversation over a delightful meal, we discussed how a 211 university in Shanghai is famous for not discriminating against students from no-title universities, while an almost equivalent 211 university in Beijing is notorious for rejecting students without 985 backgrounds, regardless of other qualifications. We playfully criticized the latter institution for its strategy, which seems unfair and shortsighted—establishing a poor reputation, possibly admitting lower-ranked 985 students (well, because it\u0026rsquo;s a 211), potentially attracting opportunistic applicants, and ultimately missing out on potentially outstanding students from non-985 universities.\nWhy do they do this? Perhaps the admission committee is risk-averse, or they are simply unwilling to sift through numerous resumes from no-title students. But the more intriguing question is whether schools truly benefit from discriminating among applicants with various titles. Without actual comparison statistics, we cannot draw definitive conclusions. I would argue that the answer is quite the opposite.\nConsider two 211 universities, $\\mathcal S$ and $\\mathcal C$, competing to admit students from a pool of applicants from 985 or 211 universities. The students\u0026rsquo; types and distribution across different universities are as follows:\nUniversity Type A Student Type B Student 985 30 30 211 24 36 Both $\\mathcal S$ and $\\mathcal C$ aim to admit 30 students to their summer programs. Assume that students can attend only one summer program. Before admission, their types are unknown, but after selection, their types become clear. Type A students are eager to secure a spot in a summer program, while Type B students are indifferent since they know they\u0026rsquo;ll rank lower than Type A students once their types are revealed. Universities prefer having as many Type A students as possible. However, there are only 54 Type A students in total, so the two universities will have to compete for them.\nIn the absence of any signals, the universities would simply admit all applicants from 985 universities and expect to have 15 Type A students each. But what if, for instance, university $\\mathcal S$ strongly signals that it won\u0026rsquo;t discriminate based on titles? In that case, all 24 Type A students may opt to apply to university $\\mathcal S$, shifting the ratio from 0.4 to 0.57—surpassing that of 985 students. University $\\mathcal C$ would face a less favorable pool of 211 applicants, whereas university $\\mathcal S$ already has a decent pool of 211 students to select from.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a simplified model, a product of a post-lunch, drowsy brainstorming session. Nevertheless, the underlying idea is that lower-tier universities may have a smaller proportion of outstanding students but a significantly larger population. By strategically signaling a reduced level of discrimination, these universities can aggregate higher numbers because the admission process essentially involves probabilities and gambling on the quality of students based on partially revealed information. Students are strategic and sensitive to signals and policy changes. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that when some universities do not act rationally (such as discriminating against certain student groups for various reasons), other universities may reap the benefits of being more astute.\n","permalink":"/posts/info_design2/","summary":"The school admissions talk continues!

Last week, Professor Haifeng Xu of Chicago University delivered an intriguing talk at SUFE-ITCS titled \u0026ldquo;Some New Frontiers of Algorithmic Information Design.\u0026rdquo; His insights rank among my top three favorite talks, and I\u0026rsquo;m not exaggerating.\nInformation has become integral to decision making in this digital era. This gives rise to a timely and explosive research topic on information design, which studies how a more informed party can strategically influence downstream agents’ behaviors through selective provision of information.\nAbstract of talk abstract from ITCS post\nPersuasion, defined as the act of exploiting an informational advantage in order to effect the decisions of others, is ubiquitous. Indeed, persuasive communication has been estimated to account for almost a third of all economic activity in the US.\nDughmi and Xu, 2016\nAt the heart of this field lies the Bayesian persuasion model (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011). In the simplest setting, consider a sender and a receiver. They share a prior of the world (hence, Bayesian) but the sender knows more information. By strategically designing the signal scheme, the sender can manipulate the (also assumed strategic) receiver\u0026rsquo;s actions, achieving favorable outcomes.\nInformation is undeniably powerful, everyone knows that. However, the true revelation lies in mathematically modeling its potential. Professor Xu\u0026rsquo;s recent talk highlighted an intriguing example involving professors strategically crafting recommendation letters for their students:\nImagine a simplified market with professors and job-seeking students on one side, and employers on the other. Professors possess precise knowledge of their students\u0026rsquo; abilities, whereas employers remain unaware. Conflict arises when employers seek brilliant PhDs, while professors aim to secure jobs for as many students as possible. Leveraging their informational advantage, professors strategically signal in their cover letters to secure good positions for both brilliant and average students.\nSpoiler alert: the magic is randomization, which is not a surprise.\nThe crux of information design emerges from the interplay between conflicting interests and information asymmetry. It\u0026rsquo;s reminiscent of Braess\u0026rsquo;s paradox, where adding extra road capacity can impede traffic flow. Similarly, withholding or obfuscating information can benefit the party with the information advantage. And I won\u0026rsquo;t be surprised that in certain system structure, carefully designed information disclosure mechanisms can enhance overall welfare.\nProfessor Xu\u0026rsquo;s talk brought to mind another presentation I attended at Stanford in August (Dessein, Frankel, and Kartik, 2023). It explored the shift toward test-optional college admissions. Aka, for students applying for universities, they won\u0026rsquo;t be required to submit std test scores if they don\u0026rsquo;t want to. It seems a bit contradictory because standardized test scores have traditionally indicated future academic performance, why would the universities reject such information? The answer lies in information design as well, but this time against a third party:\nBut how can observing less information allow a college to improve its decisions? We argue that test-optional policies may be driven by social pressure on colleges’ admission decisions. We propose a model of college admissions in which a college disagrees with society on which students should be admitted. We show how the college can use a test-optional policy to reduce its “disagreement cost” with society, regardless of whether this results in a preferred student pool.\nAbstract of abstract of Dessein, Frankel, and Kartik\u0026rsquo;s 2023 paper, Test-Optional Admissions.\nThis comprehensive study delves into the influence of this shift, introducing a three-party model, including societal \u0026ldquo;critics\u0026rdquo; (like, scrutinizer of college\u0026rsquo;s admissions such as anxious parents, gossiping reporters, even local courts). While universities seek diverse student bodies, society values fairness. Conflicts arise, but information design can enable universities to admit preferred students while minimizing criticism, even if their admission criteria are public.\nTo be honest, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t enthralled by this research at the first sight - I was still in the aftermath of another heart transplant market design research work earlier by then. However, my interest reignited before Professor Xu\u0026rsquo;s talk. This type of research genuinely captivates me.\nSome of my thoughts: Regarding the Bayesian Persuasion Model, I\u0026rsquo;m exploring the possibility of integrating it with the Pandora box decision framework (Xu et al., SOTA 2023) and advertising theory (Anderson and Renault, 1999). This alignment makes sense and aligns with ongoing work with a professor.\nIn the case of optional standardized test college admissions, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to consider heterogeneous student strategies, given diverse types and test scores. The dynamics become even more intriguing when multiple universities participate simultaneously.\nFurthermore, graduate school admission remains an underexplored area compared to undergraduate admission. The graduate school market is nuanced, flexible, and multi-criteria, making it challenging to generalize abstract models. Nevertheless, it\u0026rsquo;s a potential avenue for exciting research.\nLast but not least, while Professor Xu\u0026rsquo;s recommendation letter model illuminates information asymmetry, it overlooks the pivotal role of students. They may not be more intelligent than their professors but can introduce complexity and volatility with their behavior, adding depth to the game. Afterall, I know too well how nasty and desperate but powerful we undergrad kids can be when we\u0026rsquo;re really into something.\n","permalink":"/posts/info_design/","summary":"The crux of information design emerges from the interplay between conflicting interests and information asymmetry.

Well\u0026hellip; at least for tonight.\nThe beauty of retail therapy is its irrationality. Today, I threw away my \u0026ldquo;maximize utility\u0026rdquo; mindset and spent the last two hours casually buying crazy clothes that I\u0026rsquo;ll probably never wear again after the first time.

As \u0026ldquo;7 rings\u0026rdquo; says, \u0026ldquo;I want it, I got it.\u0026rdquo; Overthinking just kills the fun.\nTRUE!\nMany economic studies explore irrational behaviors, but I doubt any economists would dare to use real, enthusiastic shoppers as subjects, even for field experiments analyzing sales data. Having worked in the fashion industry and studied revenue management, I understand the phenomenon from both sides. On one side, all discounts and those so-called great deals are all carefully designed to tap into shopper\u0026rsquo;s subtle psychology, to manipulate our emotions and buying momentum to make us spend more. From another side, it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to resist the lure, cause regardless of all the education and knowledge earned against consumerism, I consistently buy more than I need, all the time.\nBut the aftermath of today\u0026rsquo;s talk is strong (it\u0026rsquo;s a behavioral paper about queueing). I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but analyze the queueing equilibrium for the two fitting rooms in the store while frantically picking out pink dresses to try on, though I\u0026rsquo;ve already have more than 10 of them in my closet.\nAnd I almost never wear them btw.\n","permalink":"/posts/retail_therapy/","summary":"The beauty of retail therapy is its irrationality.

But when they finally arrive at the mathematical formulation, the actual modeling part, you found that the model is often stylized.\nI know that many renowned economists have solid math backgrounds.

Alas, procrastination\u0026hellip;\nMy parents are both doctors. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard them mentioning a joke about general surgeons: they complain about doing too many surgeries during the day and attending too many dinner parties where they drink like there\u0026rsquo;s no tomorrow at night. They refer to this lifestyle as \u0026ldquo;boring as hell, with your whole life ending like this.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s true, doctors seem to know an endless number of people. This kind of reflects the intense and complicated dynamic of networking in the medical community.\nSo, how does this all work? Well, first of all, there\u0026rsquo;s a significant mismatch between supply and demand in the medical field, especially for senior surgeons. They\u0026rsquo;re always swamped with work, but patients generally prefer an experienced doctor to perform their surgeries.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider a patient located near hospital A who needs a specific type of surgery. Typically, there would be junior doctors at hospital A who are relatively less busy and can schedule a surgery right away. However, if, let\u0026rsquo;s say, she insists on having a senior surgeon perform the surgery, she\u0026rsquo;ll probably have to wait in line for half a year (which is pretty common!).\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s sometimes a third option. If that unlucky but particular patient near hospital A happens to know someone in the local medical industry, perhaps somebody at another hospital, say, hospital B, then the six-month wait won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem. She can reach out to them, and this will set off a chain reaction of \u0026ldquo;pleading for favors\u0026rdquo; within the doctors\u0026rsquo; network. Usually, it\u0026rsquo;s just a sequence of calls from one doctor to another, like that Taylor Swift lyric:\n\u0026ldquo;You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me.\u0026rdquo;\nBut in a doctor\u0026rsquo;s version:\n\u0026ldquo;A doctor talks to his doctor friends, who talk to their friends and finally someone reach the targeted senior doctor at hospital A.\u0026rdquo;\nThe search stops when they reach the target, where the chain is typically completed within three or four calls, max. That senior doctor at the end of the chain accepts the plea and \u0026ldquo;makes some adjustments,\u0026rdquo; managing to fit in one more surgery for the patient between their already packed schedule. So, the surgery that would have been scheduled six months later can now be done right away, like next week.\nBut the network\u0026rsquo;s job isn\u0026rsquo;t finished yet. After that, the patient herself and all the doctors in the plea chain will have to repay the favor, in the backward order, resulting in another round of those dinner parties with \u0026ldquo;too much drinks.\u0026rdquo;\npro tip of attending a dinner party if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to drink alcohol: just keep eating.\n","permalink":"/posts/network1/","summary":"\u0026quot;You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me\u0026quot; - but the doctor\u0026rsquo;s version","title":"network in the medical community"},{"content":"Ariana Grande mentioned in one of her recent interviews (part of the Yours Truly 10th-anniversary Q\u0026amp;A sessions) that recording Yours Truly took her three years:\nIt took me three years to record Yours Truly.

Clearly, not everything starts off flawlessly, and Ariana\u0026rsquo;s casual honesty about it is refreshing. Though she said it with so much ease, the reality must be that her early career, before she became the Queen of streaming, likely had its share of challenges.\nOne aspect of Ariana that I admire is her authenticity. She\u0026rsquo;s very much an existentialist. In one of her backstage behind-the-scenes moments, she nervously practiced one of her incredibly challenging riffs before going on stage.

Behind every outstanding performance lies a long and diligent routine of preparation and practice. There\u0026rsquo;s always struggle and a tremendous amount of effort beneath the surface.\nAriana Grande\u0026rsquo;s attitude also serves as an inspiration. In one of my research projects, a co-worker (referred to as the \u0026ldquo;engineer\u0026rdquo; hereafter) had been procrastinating on writing a heuristic algorithm. This algorithm was crucial for our numerical research and needed testing on real-world data.

(We were lamenting the state of undergraduate classes and student behavior, so I guess that\u0026rsquo;s why.)\nthe talk and the paper. screenshot taken from SITE 2023 website.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s so interesting to recall that the conference actually began with this very talk about sleep, at 9:30 in the morning when literally no one was awake. It was quite entertaining, probably because the room was filled with researchers who had likely endured the sleep-deprived life of undergraduates before earning their spots in elite university Ph.D. programs.\nThe research idea was brilliant: offering a monetary incentive to students who managed to achieve their coveted 7-hour sleep target. As someone who wears an Apple Watch, I can relate to how effective these small nudges can be. To the extent that nowadays, even during long library sessions, I occasionally shake my arm (in my chair) to meet my daily standing goals.\nThe concept is similar for sleep incentives. Providing a financial reward right after waking up is akin to Pavlov ringing a bell before feeding his dog—a form of positive reinforcement that associates \u0026ldquo;sleep\u0026rdquo; with both material and psychological satisfaction. Once this connection is established, students are more likely to view sufficient sleep as a source of monetary or psychological satisfaction and, eventually, develop healthier sleeping habits.\nThe impact is undeniably positive, which is not surprising. What I believe is significant, but the research didn\u0026rsquo;t delve into, is the magnitude of the internal utility increase resulting from this monetary reward system. For instance, how substantial is the impact? Did students merely gain an extra 10 minutes of sleep, or did they become willing to sacrifice some social activities in pursuit of more sleep, despite the positive utility associated with those activities? Can we quantify this change in some way, such as through alterations in behavior and schedules, revealed preferences, or quantifying opportunity cost associated with various time management strategies?\nLastly, something amusing cropped up when I mentioned this research to one of the professors—a brilliant theorist who earned a math BS from Peking University, who views the problem in a distinct perspective. He immediately asked, \u0026ldquo;Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t students try to hack the system?\u0026rdquo;\nMy response was, \u0026ldquo;Why would they?

His football philosophy has revolutionized how the sport is played.\nHistorically, there have been two opposing styles of football. One is \u0026ldquo;direct football\u0026rdquo; or the diagonal ball, where the ball is passed from one side of the midfield, through the air, straight toward the winger on the other side for an attack. The other is the \u0026ldquo;scientific possession style,\u0026rdquo; which takes a more tactical approach by strategically positioning players and passing the ball for clever goals. The tension between possession and direct football has arguably been a part of English and world football ever since.\nAlthough direct football is generally considered the traditional style of play and scientific possession football is regarded as the modern one, neither is inherently superior to the other. The evolutionary trajectory of playing styles is not a straightforward shift from the old to the modern either. Man City has incorporated a lot of diagonal passing since they bought Haaland, and traces of adapted small passing tactics can even be found in teams that heavily rely on direct long-pass attacks. But, what can be certain is that when you look back at the past 15 years of football, the possession style has spread like a contagion - from Cruyff to Pep, from Barca to the Premier League, evolving from an idea into a new era of football.\nThe \u0026ldquo;six degrees of separation\u0026rdquo; principle somewhat explains how it happened. Simply put, if an innovative idea is valuable and people are willing to share or learn it, it spreads exponentially through the network. However, it takes years, or even decades of effort for several generations of players and managers to overcome the friction and inertia imposed by whatever the old system might linger on. Pep Guardiola finally made his football philosophy complete (at least that\u0026rsquo;s what the media says) by winning the unprecedented three championships for Man City this summer. But the journey began more than 22 years ago when a young Pep left Barcelona and headed overseas to study under his mentor Cruyff for possession football and prepared to become a manager.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not the effort of an individual alone. FIFA makes the rules of the game, and one of their major objectives is to make the game more appealing and enjoyable for the crowd - football is THE most popular sport in the world and FIFA certainly would like it to stay that way. Several adjustments to the rules over the past decade, in a certain way, favored the tiki-taka style because it incentivize more interesting games and strategies. It stimulates genius passes, unexpected strike-backs and, more goals. After all, one pays for a ticket to be entertained at the end of the day, don\u0026rsquo;t they?\nOverall, it\u0026rsquo;s a mutual evolution for the players and managers, intertwined with the game itself, much like the environment vs. species or market vs. consumers.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next for Man City and Pep Guardiola?

You can find it in those road-to-sucsess books bought at the airport, academic papers in psychology or economics, and even in my favorite public speaking guide, which dedicates a chapter to the topic.\nThough we still have the same 24 hours in a day as we did a century ago, the increase in productivity has made the opportunity cost of our time higher than ever before. This has led to a strong temptation to multitask, as we fear falling behind if we don\u0026rsquo;t make the most of our time. For example, as my advisor mentioned an interesting psychology lecture he listened to during his morning commute, it inspired the idea for today\u0026rsquo;s blog. I, too, am multitasking during my stochastic process class to jot down this idea. Even in my blog, I attempt to pack multiple ideas into a single sentence.\nWell, scarcity is a boon for economics but a bane for us.\nAnyway, let\u0026rsquo;s return to the main topic: the (perhaps) most impatient group in the world is\nUndergrads in an Econ lab.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re an experimental economist, you\u0026rsquo;re likely familiar with what I\u0026rsquo;m referring to. Undergrad kids are placed in front of a computer screen for an hour or two, compensated with a carefully calculated monetary sum determined by their savvy economics professors (the minimum monetary value required to attract enough participants and keep their incentives aligned with the experiment\u0026rsquo;s goals).\nAs a result, they are impatient due to the lengthy series of lottery choices and the distractions stemming from the opportunity cost of their time. Speaking as an undergrad myself, I can confidently assert that we are always thinking about something else during these experiments.\nFurthermore, these undergrads can be quite nasty. There exists a notable gap between the mindset of undergraduates in a lab and that of adults making real-life decisions involving lifetime choices or substantial financial investments. Faced with an array of weird lotteries or auction choices repeatedly presented on a computer screen, and with rewards sometimes drastically discounted (for instance, asking you to make a decision based on hundred-dollar-scale but then reducing the reward to a mere $0.2), you might find yourself thinking, \u0026ldquo;Why bother? I\u0026rsquo;ll just go with the most absurd option they offer.

Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\nImagine you\u0026rsquo;re planning your Friday night. You have a feasible set of actions denoted as $\\mathcal A$ and an estimated utility value for each action, expressed as a cumulative distribution function (CDF): $$ F_a(\\cdot):\\R \\to [0, 1),a\\in \\mathcal A $$ You then select an action $a^\\star \\in \\mathcal A$, and carry it out. For instance $a^\\star = \\textit{dating your partner}$. Notice that when making this decision, you exclude all other alternatives from your set of options, like another $a\u0026rsquo;=\\textit{going to Friday Night Waltz}$.\nTypically, people make decisions based on some optimization approach (although some unconventional individuals might rely on a purely randomized strategy). In formal terms, given a utility perception function $c: \\mathcal F_\\mathcal A\\to \\R$, where $\\mathcal F_\\mathcal A:={F_a: a\\in \\mathcal A}$, they choose their best available option as follows: $$ \\max_ac(F_a)\\ \\text{subject to } a\\in \\mathcal A,\\ F_a\\in \\mathcal F_\\mathcal A $$ (As an example, for homo economicus - those perfectly rational know-it-all expected utility maximizer, $c = \\mathbb E[u_a] = \\int_\\R xF_a\u0026rsquo;(x)\\ dx$)\nSo far so good. However, on the subsequent Saturday morning, things start to unravel for those who take opportunity cost into account. For the chosen action $a^\\star$, you experience a fixed value $v^\\star$. And for all other actions, your beliefs are updated based on the known value of $a^\\star$, resulting in $\\bar c (a | a^\\star)$. Without loss of generality, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that $\\bar c(a^\\star | v^\\star) = v^\\star$. People who consider opportunity cost perceive their ex-post utility as: $$ \\bar u(v^\\star, a^\\star) = \\bar c(a^\\star|v^\\star) - \\max_{a\\in \\mathcal A\\setminus a^\\star}\\bar c(a|v^\\star) $$ which, sadly, can sometimes yield a negative result. Even worse, some people tend to be \u0026ldquo;regretful,\u0026rdquo; overestimating the utility of what they didn\u0026rsquo;t choose. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: $$ \\bar c(a|v^\\star) \u0026lt; c(a)\\text{ for }a\\ne a^\\star $$ In simpler terms:\n\u0026ldquo;You literally have no idea of the sacrifice I made by giving up my favorite social dance event to spend time with you!

I would say it’s boring as well as enjoyable, but it’s certainly a waste of time. What\u0026rsquo;s even more annoying is that none of my teammates are as skilled as I am in this area, so I\u0026rsquo;ll have to do it anyway.\nhehe. i know i\u0026rsquo;m good at this - combining my aesthetic and research\nWhat about it then? There\u0026rsquo;s a saying that data visualization is an art. Hmm, I would pause to re-consider that opinion. People often label everything they find hard to explain or that has multiple criteria for success as an art. Debating this, however, requires tracing back to the philosophical definition of art and the characterization of what exactly data visualization is. Let\u0026rsquo;s just admit that data visualization is a comprehensive process that involves multiple disciplines: computer science, design, psychology, and whatever else might be relevant.\nAnyway, what first comes to your mind when you hear the term \u0026ldquo;data visualization\u0026rdquo;? Narrowly speaking, when we talk about data visualization (DV), we\u0026rsquo;re mostly referring to charts and graphs drawn with respect to numerical data, like an Excel spreadsheet. Often, DV is associated with the tools used to convert numerical data into graphs and charts—Python, Excel, and other software.\nMy earliest memory of DV dates back to primary school computer science classes. The teacher gave us some formatted course grades in .xlsx and taught us how to draw a histogram based on that data. The data was well-organized and clean, and all we had to do was \u0026ldquo;click the right positions step by step\u0026rdquo;—first, locate somewhere in the menu bar to create the chart, then select the correct region in the table, and voilà—here\u0026rsquo;s the visualization!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s how you teach primary school kids data visualization. And essentially, that\u0026rsquo;s still how they teach data visualization today. They give you a readily formatted data chart, teach step by step how to use their software tool, and make the whole process seem effortless, luring you into thinking that those beautifully intricate diagrams can be created with just a few clicks and without much thought or design.\nScrew that. It’s impossible.\nPrinciple Theorem. One can never visualize beyond what they can envision.\nIn other words, there\u0026rsquo;s no way that you can derive any profound insights from messy data using a fancy visualization tool. You simply cannot conjure logic out of thin air.\nTherefore, the focus of teaching and learning data visualization should not be on attempting to master the software but on understanding the internal logic of converting numbers into meaningfully organized pixels. For example, when it comes to Python, instead of trying to thoroughly master the complicated syntax of Matplotlib, it\u0026rsquo;s actually more important to (1) understand how to format data to fit the visualization tool and (2) know how to read the manual, documentation, or even Stack Overflow.\nMatplotlib or any other tools are never superior to one another. But logic and ideas are, and they matter.\nBehind any fancy data illustration, there are essential components:\n(1) A topic that gives the data real value; otherwise, why not visualize some Gaussian noise?\n(2) A mathematical core idea that unveils the data\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic logic.\n(3) Some aesthetics that emphasize the visualization and prevent it from being intolerably unaesthetic.\nThe suggestion would be to master a data processing technique—whether it\u0026rsquo;s R, Python, or an Excel spreadsheet. Though the last option might seem inferior, it exists for a reason, and I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it here. Then, you can process the data and feed it into whatever visualization tool you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with—whether it\u0026rsquo;s those fancy online plotting platforms, etc. Methods are infinite, but the overall logic remains the same: Our principle theorem tells us that one needs to understand the underlying mathematical logic to create effective visualizations.\nLast but not least, integrate a bit of artistic sense into the final product—it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a masterpiece of art, but certainly, don\u0026rsquo;t make it pathetically ugly.\n","permalink":"/posts/data_vis/","summary":"Matplotlib or any other tools are never superior to one another.

I do not hold any copyright claims over the images presented herein. I harbor no hostility, nor do I intend to make derogatory remarks about any auction houses. On the contrary, I genuinely appreciate and acknowledge their irreplaceable contributions and professional endeavors within the realm of the art world.\nIn short, please don\u0026rsquo;t sue me\u0026hellip;\nPlus if there is any fact wrong or opinion biased please remind and correct me. Any discussion is welcomed.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go back to the initial, primitive, and most well-known impression of auctions - auctions that are run by renowned auction houses and sell real estate, fine art, antiques, and wines. (Finally, not the crazily abstract Google Ad auction that you definitely want to murder the scientist who invented that stuff).\nOne of the top auction houses - Christie\u0026rsquo;s. \u0026lt;- Take a look at their website, they definitely know art!\nThe fine art market, along with the classical auctions that serve as the spotlight of the industry, in my point of view, is a lucrative field for academic study. It\u0026rsquo;s an interdisciplinary field encompassing game theory, law, finance, psychology, and, of course, art. The market size is huge in terms of monetary value - and relatively free and anonymous and harder to regulate because, well, art is art while everything else is everything else. Because of this, it attracts a vast crowd with various motives - the whales of fortune who really own or buy the pieces; intelligent people and intermediates who seek to navigate the system to benefit themselves a little from the frenzy; and possibly sometimes, the professionals and artists who really do care about art. It might be a fertile field that generates interesting research topics, and I would definitely like to delve into it later.\nIn the fine art market, we have auction houses that act as intermediaries, coordinating the buyers and sellers by hosting auctions and providing other related services such as verification and shipping. But in the common daily item market, we have eBay as the intermediary platform as well. How are they different from each other? Intuitively, like some people who run startups in Silicon Valley would undoubtedly raise the question - why isn\u0026rsquo;t there (or can\u0026rsquo;t we establish) an open platform that facilitates online art-piece auctions, speeding up the process with transparency? Why not take over those inefficiently crappy auction houses and get the profit ourselves?\nNot really. The art market is far from being a free market that can be migrated to an app or a website; it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite - a market with friction. And people (billionaires and trillionaires) love that friction.\nTo begin with, even if the transaction fee that a public internet second-hand platform offers is substantially lower than that of auction houses (eBay charges about 15% of the total amount, but auction houses sometimes charge up to 50%), billionaires would still opt for auction houses for their anonymity and service. The sense of friction - having to pledge millions of dollars and pay to join an auction - is precisely what those rich people are looking for. They want to feel special, different from the general public, and maintain a high bar of entry to filter their \u0026ldquo;kind\u0026rdquo; into the game.\nThings become even more interesting when there are two existing rival forces - Sotheby\u0026rsquo;s and Christie\u0026rsquo;s. The two top auction houses are almost equivalent in market size and impact, essentially resulting in a duopoly competition. This leads to insanely funny dynamics, to the extent that the main expenses and human resources that the auction houses invest in are not evaluating artworks or building professional networks, but maintaining their relationships with elite sellers and buyers.\nOne of Christie\u0026rsquo;s upcoming auction - WOW! I recognize a Lichtenstein when I see one.\nSimply put, the huge imbalance of sellers and buyers (or, supply and demand) in the fine art market creates a massive incentive for the auction houses to court the sellers and pressure the buyers - especially for famous pieces. They don\u0026rsquo;t even charge the sellers for intermediary fees but compensate them with a percentage of the transaction fee charged from the buyers. Even worse, the terms are non-negotiable for the buyers but open to bargaining for the sellers. Moreover, the auction houses have huge PR departments that take care of their elite clients\u0026rsquo; personal \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo; - their kids\u0026rsquo; birthday greetings, charity events, and so on - all in an effort to maintain the trust and endorsement of their clients and encourage them to sell or buy the next Da Vinci piece.\nI would say, if some company wants a PR team, they should go hunting for talent at the auction houses - they must have the best on the planet.\nBtw, at last, I\u0026rsquo;d like to tribute a little to today\u0026rsquo;s post on the market design blog, which included a (free!) sharing link to a brilliant New York Times article. It was an enjoyable read and, as always, a valuable source of inspiration for a market designer.

It presents a model based on the inter-temporal hyperbolic discounting function, which is used to construct the choice dynamics of a naive procrastinator. The paper then designs a contract aimed at coordinating the actions of this naive procrastinator. This individual mistakenly perceives their future utility, leading to biased decisions that provide room for their employer to arbitrage. This allows the employer to exploit the naive procrastinator\u0026rsquo;s overoptimism and deceive them, ultimately making an infinite amount of money.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s quite a lengthy sentence. To be frank, the model\u0026rsquo;s mathematical formulation is elegant and clean, but it lacks practical realism. As someone haunted by OCD and plagued by procrastination, I am completely certain that at least some procrastinators do not operate in the manner described. In my case, I procrastinate due to either (i) the opportunity cost of engaging in other events or (ii) a fear of not completing the current task perfectly. Furthermore, the model assumes that the cost of work in each period is stochastic, but once started, the work is completed instantly and deterministically. This, however, does not align with real-world practices.\nI believe there is potential for enhancing the theory by incorporating a revealed preference modeling framework. This could be achieved through a more modern, computer science-integrated perspective that employs dynamic programming. Additionally, merging this approach with mechanism design could enrich the range of potential contracts.\nI promise not to procrastinate and to provide a comprehensive review and perspective on this paper and its subsequent works in the near future—let\u0026rsquo;s say, within one week—once I figure out how to type LaTeX on the blog pages.

However, I must admit that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite measure up to their earlier joint venture, Save Your Tears. It appears that the artists might be attempting to replicate their prior success, yet this endeavor seems to fall short, revealing the discerning nature of Arianators, her dedicated fan base.\nFinally, the moment we\u0026rsquo;ve all been waiting for has arrived.\nIn celebration of the tenth anniversary of Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s debut album, Yours Truly, she is gracing us with live performances of those beloved songs once again.

Intriguingly, Ariana Grande herself offers a glimpse into the authentic recording setting – exposed wires and an array of cameras capturing every angle. The video editing, however, leaves room for confusion, with noticeable transitions between different recording sessions, dispelling any notion of a continuous, single take. And lastly, while Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s affinity for post-production tools is evident, the \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; performance\u0026rsquo;s audio bears traces of imperfection, including occasional off-key moments and less-than-smooth vocal runs. One might wonder, did she stumble, or is this a deliberate act?\nFor evidence, see how the camera tray disappears within less than 1/24 second in the video:\nParticularly focusing on the song \u0026ldquo;Tattooed Heart,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that Ariana Grande penned this beautiful doo-wop ballad at the tender age of 17, releasing it in September 2013. Characterized by delicate, dreamy backup vocal harmonies, the track poses an astonishing vocal challenge. Delving into its performance history, a curated selection of live renditions of \u0026ldquo;Tattooed Heart\u0026rdquo; is readily accessible online, presented chronologically:\n[1] Ariana Grande\u0026rsquo;s Performance at the American Music Awards (2013) showcases a raw and unpolished Ariana Grande rendition. She presumably performed live without the safety net of autotune, and was screaming her lung out to hit those high notes.\n[2] iHeartRadio Pre-Halloween Concert Performance (2015) captures Ariana Grande during her early Dangerous Woman era, displaying the pinnacle of her vocal prowess. This rendition mirrors the studio version\u0026rsquo;s intricate techniques, delivered with a more mature and poised vocal approach.\n[3] Sweetener World Tour Charlotte - Birthday Dedication to Mom Special Edition (2019) stands out as the apex among the \u0026ldquo;Tattooed Heart\u0026rdquo; performances, characterized by exceptional vocal control. Noteworthy is the artistic finesse with which Ariana treats each syllable, allowing words, melodies, and crescendos to gracefully intertwine.\n[4] k bye for now (Sweetener World Tour live performance official released recording) (2019) is quintessentially Ariana Grande. Although fan-recorded versions from the Sweetener World Tour exhibit superior renditions, this official release incorporates vocal editing and splicing that puzzle even the most devoted fans.\nBut the atmosphere setting and stage lighting design is oh-my-god-ly insane. At the live performance in London, Ariana stood beneath the moon, delivering a grand and romantic performance that nearly surpassed the studio recording version.\n[5] Yours Truly Tenth Anniversary (Live from London) (2023) represents the most recent 10th-anniversary performance. Her vocals show signs of fatigue, and the artistic finesse, evident in prior performances, appears somewhat diminished. Regrettably, it is disappointing.

They are omnipresent - disturbing and distracting - especially when the algorithm always recommends the same ads that exhaust all my patience.\nObviously, Meta has a big budget cause I have seen this ad multiple times already.

Two years ago, I was the rookie, but now I’m anticipating those rookies - it is simply so much fun watching those freshmen undergrads unavoidably repeat every mistake and stupid decision I’ve made. Welcome!\nAnd, it’s about time when the pilot class programs recruit among the undergraduate freshmen.\nIn my home university, departments (i.e. School of Finance, School of Economics) hold their own pilot class programs, respectively (with fancy names like “Financial Technology Elite Program” or “Interdisciplinary Science Pilot Class.”). Compared to normal undergraduate programs, these pilot class programs offer smaller classes, more modern and advanced course designs, and most importantly, more comprehensive and early academic exposure. The university expects those students to undergo adequate academic training and rise up as new stars in academia or industry. In general, each individual program is about 20-40 students, and it indeed aggregates a more intelligently inclined crowd and provides more resources for them.\nBut the admission process, in my point of view, is a bit of a rush and, in fact, pretty unfriendly and inefficient. Here’s the bigger picture: there are a total of five pilot class programs held by five different departments recruiting simultaneously right now (in early September, several days before the term starts). The departments hold full execution rights and, of course, operate in a decentralized manner. The information about these programs is published online over August. Before September, freshmen undergrads can sign up for the application of these programs via filling and submitting an application table. Then they would be admitted based on a comprehensive evaluation of the following three criteria: (listed in time order)\nthe score of the English Level Assessment Exam - a mandatory exam held by the university where all students take and obtain a score.\na math exam designed by the departments in charge - students would apply up for a program then take it.\nan interview with the program’s committee - also, for students who apply for programs.\nThe math exam is the most critical of the three. To explain, first of all, the math exam weighs the most - about 40-80% of the overall ranking score calculated. Second, the score of the math exam is released before the interview, so it poses a prior belief of the student in the subsequent interview. Third, the English Level Assessment Exam is far less competitive and indifferentiable, hence almost useless. Therefore, in summary, whoever wants to enter the program needs to take the math exam and do it well.\nInterestingly, four of the five pilot class programs scheduled their math exams at exactly the same time on the same day. Quite a coincidence\u0026hellip; or is it?\nWait, the story isn’t over yet. Currently, as a member of one of the pilot class programs, I have to share a bit more about the admission offering that follows. After the math exam and the interview, on the night before the term starts, I received a phone call from the program’s committee, informing me that I had been accepted - precisely when I was having dinner with my family. It was a bit of a surprise and a shock because enrolling in a program means waiving one’s original major and getting transferred to a new trajectory. It’s a crossroad of life. But the people on the phone were so impatient. As I tried to say, “Yeah sure sorry but can I get back to you a little later…” a man on the other side of the call yelled in the background, “Take it or leave it, now!” They were insistent on an immediate answer. The situation was intimidating.\nFor me, I got in with almost no hesitation because my parents forced me to study economics, but I hated it and wanted to escape - so I took my chance - and now I’m doing market design, behavioral economics, and game theory… But after all the choice was tough in general, for a young, 18-year-old college freshman to decide his/her future in less than a minute.\nIn summary, the pilot class admission market is where similar programs operate exams at the same time, followed by exploding offers for a life-time decision. It kinda reminds me of the early medical residency market mentioned in Al Roth’s brilliant book “Who Gets What and Why” - insecure departments (hospitals) and students, quick-unraveling and explodarding offers. There’s a lot of room for coordination and improvement for sure. Perhaps, by coordinating every program’s exam to make it feasible for students to participate in multiple programs’ exams, and running a joint deferred-acceptance afterward with all the programs and students, the pilot class program admission market would be thicker, information would be more transparent, and it would be much easier a time for students and the committees.\nBUT - I’m grateful for the program that admitted me and introduced me to my current field of research. The man who yelled on the other side of the phone for the exploding offer is now my favorite professor. Mi familia académica! And, I love economics and computer science now, honestly.\n","permalink":"/posts/pilot_class_market/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s a too quick an unravel market with four programs having exams on the exact same time, followed by exploding offers.

I am back in Guangzhou, finally!\nCantonese-style black Char Siu\nFor those who don’t know, Guangzhou is one of the three first-tier cities in China (the others are Beijing amd Shanghai). But more importantly, we have a grounded and welcoming citizen culture, as well as the most delicious recipes in the world.\nice and fire pinapple bun with butter - best served with HK-style milk tea\nThanks to my dad’s obsession with luscious cuisine, our family gathered for a Saturday dinner, which is the source of inspiration for this blog. A friend sitting next to me has just finished his High School Entrance Examination and gone through the admission process.\nsautéed boneless eel with green onions and ginger\nDisclaimer: Having been a high school student in Guangzhou, I experienced the admission process myself years ago, where the mechanism was slightly different. The content today is based on a dinner talk and serves only for research purposes. In case of any potential mistakes, I apologize beforehand.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s hit the topic\u0026hellip; In June, middle school graduates attend the High School Entrance Examination, and their scores then serve as the ranking metric in the subsequent admission process. Notably, students’ preference list is submitted before they take the exam.\nNow for the mechanism. A high-level overview: Guangzhou’s high school admission mechanism involves multiple stages of the Boston mechanism, running centrally and sequentially. Perhaps due to the heterogeneity of student types and high school criteria, the multi-stage operation can introduce necessary versatility and flexibility to the admission process.\nMy brilliant friend was luckily admitted into his dream school in the second stage, which, according to him and his mother’s recall, is the most strategic and opportunistic stage among the admission process. For the second stage, first of all, the admission headcount of each high school is allocated to each middle school through a random lottery. Say we have M middle schools and N high schools; then we’ll have an M*N matrix of headcount assignment as a result of the lottery. The result of headcount assignment is then released and becomes public prior information for the second stage admission. Before the exam, students submit all of their preference lists (for all stages) before the exam takes place, which includes the preference list of the second-stage admission—exactly three slots for each student. Lastly, all students’ preference lists run through a Boston mechanism with respect to the headcount matrix as a constraint and a pre-determined reserved score line. If admitted, student exit the admission system; if not, student continue onto the third stage where another Boston mechanism with 6 preference slots for each student is run city-wise (compared to headcounts assigned school-wise).\nWhat about the result? The mechanism doesn’t have an obvious dominant strategy, and there exists potential space for strategizing. According to my friend’s mother, it was during the second stage that they mainly spent time thinking about:\n“The target high school (which is a very prestigious and popular school) that we opted for only has one headcount for his middle school. But everybody else in our middle school also dared not list that school as the first choice because there’s a super capable girl in our middle school who is probably going to score very high in the exam and would, for sure, secure that high school’s only headcount if she wants to. But we took a risk and listed that school as our first choice anyway—and we got in! It was so lucky… For one thing, surprisingly we outscored that girl in the exam eventually and managed to get that one-and-only headcount in the second stage admission; for another, if we try to get into that same high school in the subsequent third stage of the admission process, the score threshold (in the third stage) is even higher than what we reached.”\nWhat a game! The second stage is quite novel because I didn’t have any impression of something similar back in my days. Though seemingly complicated, judging from my friend’s experience, the new mechanism certainly benefited some students and provided more geographical diversity among the admitted population. But I would also like to point out that since the second stage admission (school-wise assigned admission headcount) is based on the Boston mechanism and takes place within every middle school, there might be an incentive and potential for schools to strategize—coordinating students explicitly through open negotiations, so as to avoid the waste of headcount and stuff as many students into ideal high schools as possible.\nAnyway\u0026hellip; The Boston-flavored high school admission mechanism in Guangzhou has been running for decades, and I’m so happy to see that it’s evolving and my friend got admitted into his dream school because of the improvement. The strategic nature of the admission process would force the students and their parents to thoroughly study their potential future high schools, thus possibly making more rational decisions. From another perspective, the headcount lottery would improve geographical diversity and equity among the city’s high schools. Nice.\nAgain, congratulations to my outstanding little fellow for achieving a milestone in his academic career and best wishes for his upcoming high school life! And hopefully, the blog contributes some insightful viewpoints to my dearest hometown.\nFun fact: family decisions are usually highly involved in the decision making process of high-school application. In our case, my friend\u0026rsquo;s mother helped and controlled throughout the process. BUT interestingly, his dad had completely no idea what is going on, at all.\n","permalink":"/posts/high_school_admission/","summary":"The Boston-flavored high school admission mechanism in Guangzhou has been running for decades, and I’m so happy to see that it’s evolving and my friend got admitted into his dream school because of the improvement.","title":"anecdotal facts about the high school admission in Guangzhou"},{"content":"We dream in summer.\nDuring the summer of 2023, I visited Stanford University and was very fortunate to meet several brilliant human beings who undoubtedly influenced me so much that in certain way, changed my life.\nOne of them is Alvin Roth.\nBeing a fan of Al Roth early on through a podcast, I bombarded him with emails the moment I arrived at Stanford - and the amazing Nobel laureate replied.
