How Food Affects the Mind and Body
December 20, 2022, The Economist

the trend

The economic downturn has led capital to venture into the general food industry, especially in Shanghai, where bakeries are flourishing.\nChained, standardized bakeries, cafés, and restaurants are replacing the ecosystem of traditional, often independently operated businesses. These establishments offer oily, sugary, and unhealthy products like creamy cakes and cookies or large, over-served portions of meals and buffets. Positioned as luxury enjoyments and sold at inflated prices, these options are capturing the attention and money of the younger population.\nThe Solution Being mindful of what we consume is crucial. According to observations, women are often more adept and knowledgeable about dieting. Various methods like the 16-8 fasting method, cheat days, ketogenic diet, Mediterranean diet (high in vegetables, fruits, pulses, and whole grains, low in red and processed meats and saturated fats), and the MIND diet (emphasizing berries over other fruits) are popular. I have personally experimented with all these diets.\nInsights from The Economist “A good meal has a positive impact on one’s mood. Part of that pleasure is immediate. Those who avoid overindulgence and family squabbles will enjoy a postprandial rise in their blood sugar. That will prompt a flood of endorphins—chemicals that act as happy hormones—to rush through their brains.”\nAnimal proteins, such as those found in roast fowl, hams, or fish, contain essential amino acids necessary for the production of dopamine and serotonin, neurotransmitters that regulate pleasure, reward, and mood. Brussels sprouts contain folate, crucial for brain function, while cranberries are high in vitamin C, which is involved in converting dopamine to noradrenaline, another neurotransmitter.\nWith mental-health disorders on the rise, scientists are increasingly investigating how food or nutritional supplements affect the mind. The brain, being the most complex and energy-demanding organ, has specialized nutritional needs. Emerging research in nutritional psychiatry highlights the significance of diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, flavonoids, antioxidants, and resveratrol. These nutrients, found in foods like walnuts, tea, wine, berries, and red grapes, promote neuron growth and reduce inflammatory processes in the brain, which is associated with a lower risk of developing depression.\nThe link between diet and mental health is becoming clearer. The Mediterranean diet, for instance, is shown to decrease the chances of experiencing strokes, cognitive impairment, and depression. A green Mediterranean diet high in polyphenols reduces age-related brain atrophy, while the MIND diet, emphasizing berry consumption, lessens the risk of dementia.\n“Nutritional science is understudied partly because it is hard to do well. Randomized controlled trials, used to test drugs, are tricky. Few people want to stick to an experimental diet for years. Instead, most nutritional science is based on observational studies that try to establish associations between particular foods or nutrients and diseases.”\nWhile 10% of adults in America consume their recommended daily serving of vegetables, the majority turn to vitamin and mineral supplements to make up for dietary deficiencies. Despite the prevalence of supplements, rigorous research on their benefits and risks is limited. The potential of micronutrients to treat mental-health conditions remains an intriguing yet underexplored area of study.\nIn conclusion, the food we consume significantly affects both our physical and mental health. Being mindful of our diet, experimenting with scientifically-backed dietary methods, and understanding the nutritional needs of our brain can help improve our overall well-being. As nutritional psychiatry continues to evolve, it offers promising insights into how we can better nourish our minds and bodies through our dietary choices.\n",

Instead, most nutritional science is based on observational studies that try to establish associations between particular foods or nutrients and diseases.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While 10% of adults in America consume their recommended daily serving of vegetables, the majority turn to vitamin and mineral supplements to make up for dietary deficiencies. Despite the prevalence of supplements, rigorous research on their benefits and risks is limited. The potential of micronutrients to treat mental-health conditions remains an intriguing yet underexplored area of study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the food we consume significantly affects both our physical and mental health. Being mindful of our diet, experimenting with scientifically-backed dietary methods, and understanding the nutritional needs of our brain can help improve our overall well-being. As nutritional psychiatry continues to evolve, it offers promising insights into how we can better nourish our minds and bodies through our dietary choices.</p>
