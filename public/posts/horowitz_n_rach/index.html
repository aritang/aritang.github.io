<p>Vladimir Horowitz and Sergei Rachmaninoff had each suffered great losses in the Russian Revolution of 1917. “We lost absolutely everything,” Horowitz told author, radio personality, and Steinway Artist David Dubal, as reported in Dubal’s book, <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Reflections_from_the_keyboard.html?id=VfgXAQAAIAAJ">Reflections from the Keyboard</a>.</em> “In 24 hours, all we had we lost.”</p>
