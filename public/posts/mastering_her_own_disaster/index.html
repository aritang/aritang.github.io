Taylor Swift&rsquo;s recent outcry over the control of her early masters highlights a lesser-known, yet crucial aspect of the music business: the power dynamics between artists and record labels.

In the history of the music business, many artists have not had control over their own careers. What has recently made the topic into major news is that Taylor Swift has discussed her torrid experience in the industry. The pop star has a long record of challenging the powers that be, and while her latest battle is unlikely to end in victory, she has shone a light on one of the less understood aspects of how artists and record labels interact.">

Record companies operate in a similar way to pharmaceutical companies. Both spend fortunes on research and development, and in both cases most of the expenditure does not result in revenue. Pharma companies patent their drugs so they can make the money that feeds future research. Similarly, labels own recordings in exchange for the investment they have made not just in that artist—it can cost up to $1m to take an act from signing to their first release, with no guarantee of a hit—but also to fund new artists, of whom between one in four and one in ten will become successful.\nWhile some artists manage to negotiate terms to retain or eventually reclaim their masters, the majority find themselves in a perpetual struggle for control over their music, underscoring the imbalance of power inherent in the industry.\nOften, powerful artists will regain control of their masters.

But not always: Prince became The Artist Formerly Known as Prince in protest at Warner Brothers’ ownership of his recordings, and his catalogue is now bafflingly split: Warner owns everything released before 1996, Sony everything after.\nIn wrapping up our discussion, the situation is layered with complexities that extend far beyond the superficial narrative of artists versus corporate giants. Record labels indeed guard their investments fiercely. As for Taylor Swift, her vocal battles against industry norms serve both as a beacon for artist rights and a clever maneuver within her own narrative of personal and creative autonomy.\nMs Swift’s distrust of Mr Braun appears to be as much personal as professional. As she is one of the biggest pop stars around, there is plenty of incentive for Mr Braun to try to generate as much revenue as possible from her Big Machine recordings, from which Ms Swift will continue to receive her contractual share. Still, all this is not quite as simple as the Big Bad Music Industry exploiting the poor, innocent artist. If it were, then no one would ever sign away their masters—but they do.\nThis tussle over master recordings, often dramatized as a clear-cut case of artistic victimhood, subtly underscores the sophisticated dance of interests that defines the music business.
