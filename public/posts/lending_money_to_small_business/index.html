  <div class="post-content"><p>In choosing between issuing a 1-billion loan to one massive state-owned enterprise or lending 1 million to a thousand smaller companies, most would prefer the first option as it seems more convenient and reliable. However, Zhejiang Tailong Commercial Bank (TaiLong Bank) takes the less-traveled path – the bank provides financial services to small-and-micro-enterprises (SMEs). Since its inception, the bank has cumulatively provided over ¥150 billion (around $23 billion) in loans, with an average loan size of ¥500,000, to its clientele, over 90% of whom are peasants-turned-entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The bank originates in Taizhou, Zhejiang, an area that cradles family-owned workhouses which often develop into medium or even large-size production companies.

<p>There are three main challenges of SME financing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Informational Asymmetry</strong>: For small businesses, their accounting is often messy, thus standardized financial records that bear strong supportive power are often absent.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: For example, a family-owned steamed bread house might receive an instant gigantic order and need to loan more money to purchase the corresponding ingredients that would otherwise be budget-infeasible for them.
