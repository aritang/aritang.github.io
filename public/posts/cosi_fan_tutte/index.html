Pro Tips for classical performances, especially grand productions like Ballet and Opera:

Arrive early (1 hour&#43;) to attend pre-show lectures, explore the venue, take a glass of wine, or just chill in the bathroom.

The title &ldquo;Così fan tutte&rdquo; is Italian for &ldquo;Thus do all women&rdquo;, often interpreted as &ldquo;All women are like that.&rdquo; The opera, composed by Mozart with a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte, is a comedic yet thought-provoking exploration of love, fidelity, and human nature. It tells the story of two young soldiers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, who make a bet with the cynical philosopher Don Alfonso that their fiancées, Dorabella and Fiordiligi, will remain faithful to them. To test their lovers, the men pretend to go off to war, only to return in disguise and attempt to seduce each other’s fiancée.">

<p>Pro Tips for classical performances, especially grand productions like Ballet and Opera:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrive early (1 hour+) to attend pre-show lectures, explore the venue, take a glass of wine, or just chill in the bathroom.</li>
<li>Read the synopsis on the handouts. It&rsquo;s generally a good idea to read the plot before attending an opera or ballet.

<p>The title <em>&ldquo;Così fan tutte&rdquo;</em> is Italian for <em>&ldquo;Thus do all women&rdquo;</em>, often interpreted as <em>&ldquo;All women are like that.&rdquo;</em> The opera, composed by <strong>Mozart</strong> with a libretto by <strong>Lorenzo Da Ponte</strong>, is a comedic yet thought-provoking exploration of love, fidelity, and human nature. It tells the story of two young soldiers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, who make a bet with the cynical philosopher Don Alfonso that their fiancées, Dorabella and Fiordiligi, will remain faithful to them. To test their lovers, the men pretend to go off to war, only to return in disguise and attempt to seduce each other’s fiancée.</p>
<p>At first, the women resist, but under the influence of their mischievous maid, Despina, and Don Alfonso’s manipulations, they eventually succumb. The deception escalates to a mock wedding before the truth is revealed, leaving all four lovers humiliated and uncertain about their relationships. The opera ends ambiguously—some productions suggest reconciliation, while others highlight the damage caused by the test.
