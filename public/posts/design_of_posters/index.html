Here’s a bit more, borrowing a few tricks from fashion.\nThink about how we notice outfits: first shape, then color; then perhaps those quirky, unconventional details. Last will be the texture. (which is to say, don’t overload anyone with too much text).\nFor posters, the same logic applies. Step into your audience’s shoes. What’s the first thing they’ll notice as they pass by? Maybe it’s the bold title. Or maybe it’s that oversized, slightly ridiculous bumblebee illustration (well, distraction works if it pulls attention away from other posters…). Next, consider what they’ll see if they lean in closer—perhaps some juicy details in your subheadings. Finally, for the ultra-curious 1% who scrutinize every line, make sure the fine print is worth their effort.\nsoftware choice There’s always a debate about which software to use for poster design. My advice is go for the best tools available—think Adobe Illustrator, Linearity Curve, or any other vector-based graphic program that offers flexibility and power. There’s no need to optimize tradeoffs over the learning curve. Stuck on an overly simplified design tool would waste more hours than learning a full-featured software. Trust me, the effort you put into mastering a versatile program will pay off in the long run. Also, those high-end professional designer programs are much easier to use now than 10 years ago.\nOh, and don’t forget the ultimate conference power move: plaster your name and contact info in a way that’s impossible to miss. Make it memorable. Make it bold. Heck, make it selfie-worthy if you can. Good luck!\n",
