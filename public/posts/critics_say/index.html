There’s no hierarchy of tragic detail; these songs fail to distill an overarching emotional truth, tending to smother rather than sting. It would help if Swift were exploring new musical ideas, but she is largely retreading old territory—unsurprising, perhaps, given that the last three years of her life have been consumed by re-recording her old albums and touring her past selves. The new music is colored in familiar shades of Antonoff (sparse drum programming, twinkly synths) and Dessner (suppler, more strings). Songs sound like other songs—“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” like Midnights’ “Mastermind”; the intro of “So Long, London” like that of Folklore’s “My Tears Ricochet.” Her melodies feel staid, like they are made to fit the music, rather than the other way around.\nDespite recent criticism of Pitchfork getting soft and somewhat biased, it is still regarded as perhaps one of the most influential and professional voice in music. Music reviews are multi-faceted. Because evaluating a product (or, art, if you’d prefer) on a 0-10 scale is just unrealistic and impossible. Looking at its written reviews, one can find how the media and its reviewers carefully balance public opinion, personal bias as well as mere quality of the music so as to sustain reputation as well as lead the opinions. It’s delicate. But, what’s left though, at the end of the day when the bubbles fade out, is music.\n",
