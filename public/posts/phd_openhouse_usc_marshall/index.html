USC has a beautiful campus located in a delightful and convenient neighborhood.\nOne of the most interesting thing was when I tried to crowdsource representative attributes for a good PhD student by asking everyone the question: What makes a popular job market candidate? Their responses provided a well-rounded view of what it takes to stand out. Below are the key takeaways:\nMaster a particular domain. Depth matters. Establishing expertise in a focused area is crucial. Balance technical depth with impact. Strong theoretical foundations should be complemented by practical implications. Choose an important, contemporary, and fundamental problem. Research should be disciplined, impactful, and meaningful. Prioritize contribution depth in a paper over quantity. Quality of contribution matters more than the number of publications. Own the problem. Demonstrate a deep understanding to a model/method and commitment to solving it fundamentally. Start with an interesting problem. Passion and curiosity drive impactful research. **Invest in Theory and Applied Research (3:1) ** Having both strengthens the publication portfolio. The academic job market is unpredictable. There is no fixed formula for success. Strong research is a given, but the process also involves positioning and advisor support. In the end, cracking the PhD job market is like solving a non-convex black box optimization problem—there are personal, even unknown constraints, randomness, and no closed-form solution. But with depth, impact, and a bit of strategic maneuvering, we might just maximize our chances.\nCourtesy to everyone in Marshall DSO. A truly well-organized and successful open house, showcasing an exceptionally supportive culture. One faculty member described it as “a boutique PhD program”—indeed. It’s well-structured, with an excellent student body, super strong group of people, and great care and attention for the students, plus generous funding. And of course, LA is gorgeous!\n",
