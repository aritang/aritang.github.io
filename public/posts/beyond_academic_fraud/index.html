Data Colada incident. Francesca Gino is a professor at Harvard Business School. She has been accused of intentionally manipulating data in a few of her highly-cited papers, whistles blew by the Data Colada team led by three professors from ESADE Barcelona, U Penn and Berkeley. Harvard suspended Gino’s employment. Gino filed defamation lawsuit against Harvard and Data Colada—the lawsuit against Dala Colada was dismissed Sep 2024 (\"Honesty researcher’s lawsuit against data sleuths dismissed, Science\")\nThe lawsuit has been controversial, people, especially insiders from academia, aren’t particularly happy with their colleague’s action. Vox “A disgraced Harvard professor sued them for millions.

(Kelsey Piper, May 2024)”.\nextended opinions: One part from Boston.com makes me rethink my attitude towards research in general (not merely about authenticity but also about quality and popularity of work).
