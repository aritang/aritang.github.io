Batching and Optimal Multi-stage Bipartite Allocations
Yiding Feng and Rad Niazadeh
In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online marketplaces, the platform allows for some latency to batch the demand and improve the efficiency of the resulting matching. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal trade-off between batching and inefficiency in the context of designing robust online allocations. As our base model, we consider K-stage variants of the classic vertex weighted bipartite b-matching in the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stage-wise and in K batches — in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for this problem is an optimal 1−(1−1/K)^K- competitive (fractional) matching algorithm, improving the classic (1 − 1/e) competitive ratio bound known for its online variant (Mehta et al., 2007; Aggarwal et al., 2011). We also extend this result to the rich model of multi-stage configuration allocation with free-disposals (Devanur et al., 2016), which is motivated by the display advertising application in the context of video streaming platforms.">

At each stage, our fractional multi-stage algorithm returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this stage (by solving the convex program). By providing structural decomposition of the underlying graph using the optimal solutions of these convex programs and recursively connecting the regularizers together, we develop a new multi-stage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive ratio of this algorithm.

<p>In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online marketplaces, the platform allows for some latency to batch the demand and improve the efficiency of the resulting matching. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal trade-off between batching and inefficiency in the context of designing robust online allocations. As our base model, we consider K-stage variants of the classic vertex weighted bipartite b-matching in the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stage-wise and in K batches — in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for this problem is an optimal 1−(1−1/K)^K- competitive (fractional) matching algorithm, improving the classic (1 − 1/e) competitive ratio bound known for its online variant (Mehta et al., 2007; Aggarwal et al., 2011). We also extend this result to the rich model of multi-stage configuration allocation with free-disposals (Devanur et al., 2016), which is motivated by the display advertising application in the context of video streaming platforms.</p>
