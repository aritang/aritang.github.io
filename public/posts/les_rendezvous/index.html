This performing production is dedicated by the Frederick Ashton Foundation, with its original designs created by William Chappell, choreography done by Ashton, of course.\nBtw:\nWilliam Chappell (27 September 1907 – 1 January 1994) was a British dancer, ballet designer and director. He is most noted for his designs for more than 40 ballets or revues, including many of the early works of Sir Frederick Ashton and Dame Ninette de Valois.\nRoyal Ballet’s Founder Choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton (17 September 1904 – 18 August 1988) was a British ballet dancer and choreographer. Ashton is widely credited with the creation of a specifically English genre of ballet.\nLes Rendezvous was Ashton’s first substantial classical composition and an exultant statement of his idiosyncratic approach to academic ballet. It consists of a succession of light-hearted dances in a park where friends meet and socialize. Ashton’s choreographic skills shine through in the minute detail: the little glances and gestures, the pauses and the double takes which introduces to the individual characters, often provoking us into a heartful smile (Les Rendezvous, The Dream, Rhapsody. 2024, Royal Opera House, on Soundcloud.).\nThe Dream 🧚🏼🧚🏼🧚🏼 Frederick Ashton’s knitted the charm of Shakespeare and Mendelssohn’s gossamer-light music into The Dream—a ballet production of summer.\nTitania: “Out of this wood do not desire to go. Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no”\nAnd more fairies:\nMendelssohn is becoming Mariah Carey of June.\nRhapsody Rhapsody was created in 1980 and is one of Frederick Ashton’s final works. The ballet is set to Sergey Rachmaninoff’s well-known Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, which moves from stormy passages to calmer interludes.\nIt was created on acclaimed Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, who requested the Ashton commission and whose personality is at the heart of the work. The male Principal role is characterized by exceptionally fluent leaps, turns and lightness of movement. It is twinned with the strength and grace of the ballerina, a role created on the pure, fleet-footed style of former Royal Ballet Principal Lesley Collier.\nThe premiere of Rhapsody was given at the Royal Opera House in honour of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on the occasion of her 80th birthday.\n——more, from the official program website of the Royal Opera House.\n",
