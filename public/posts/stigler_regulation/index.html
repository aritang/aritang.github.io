<p>George Stigler (1911-1991) introduced his &ldquo;Theory of Economic Regulation&rdquo; in 1971 trying to answer this question in a well-established framework, on the basis of some previous empirical arguments such as Normative Analysis as a Positive Theory (NPT) or Capture Theory (CT).</p>

</figure>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the paper is about:</p>
<p>Previously, it was criticized that sometimes regulations fail to address general public interest: for example, the gasoline import quota is bad for the national security and consumer surplus, and that it only benefits the oligopolies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So many economists, for example, have denounced the ICC for its pro-railroad policies that this has become a cliche of the literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stigler argues that this is natural in the first place—that regulations emerges because interest parties pushes their supported political representatives to promote them. <strong>The paper&rsquo;s central thesis is that regulation is often sought by industries and designed primarily for their benefit, rather than for the public good.</strong></p>
<h2 id="assumptions">assumptions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assumptions">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The regulatory authority has the power to coerce.</p>
<p>An interest group that can convince the regulatory authority to use its power of coercion for the benefit of that group can improve the group’s well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic agents are utility maximizers:</p>
<p>interest groups attempt to enhance its well-being by securing favorable regulation from the authority that serves to redistribute wealth from others to the interest group.</p>
<p>The authority (or, the political systems) on the other hand, seeks financial and public support of the interest groups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take democracy for granted—still, it is unreasonable to require every individual agents to vote over every regulatory decisions. But the democratic decision process must involve <strong>all</strong> the community, not simply the ones who are directly concerned with the particular regulatory issue (for example, a vegeterian citizen may still have to be involved in the decision of regulation over the consumption of horse meat in California). This impossibility requirement for efficiency is resolved by having numerous levels of government, quote the original paper:</p>
