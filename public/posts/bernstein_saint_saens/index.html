My dear young friends, music has lots of different uses in life. There are pieces that lift your spirit or interest your mind, or fill you with religious or passionate or dreamy or triumphant feelings. But some pieces are written only to amuse you, and one of them is this Carnival of the Animals, by the charming and masterful French composer Saint-Saëns. For one thing, it&rsquo;s a sort of looney fantasy about a zoo, full of amusement and frolic. And although it&rsquo;s written by Saint-Saëns mainly to amuse his friends, it was also partly intended to give young music students something for play that might be fun, instead of always that serious grind.">
