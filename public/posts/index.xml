      <description>Cookies, small text files stored on a user&amp;rsquo;s local computer, are pivotal in carrying information across the internet. This is because the HTTP protocol (the way we communicate with the web) does not retain information between sessions. To store and retrieve any information—even something as simple as what was entered before and after clicking the &amp;lsquo;search&amp;rsquo; button—we and the web need cookies. This mechanism makes our browsing experience seamlessly smooth.</description>

      <description>Optimizing Product Launches in the Presence of Strategic Consumers. By Ilan Lobel, Jigar Patel, Gustavo Vulcano, and Jiawei Zhang.
Management Science 2016. DOI https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2189
The paper studies firm&amp;rsquo;s product launch policy. It is motivated by the industry example, where tech firms iteratively release new models of their products. For example, Apple releasing one new iPhone models almost every 12-18 months, or Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s upcoming switch 2 that has been overdued 7 years (still is though).</description>

      <description>A .json file is a text file formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). It is a lightweight data-interchange format, that is easy enough for human to read and write, but also easy for machine to parse and generate. JSON is frequently used to transmit data between a server and web applications, or using to store lightweight data.
In Python, one can load JSON file using json library:

      <description>In the spirit of Karl Lagerfeld who once said, &amp;ldquo;I like the idea of craziness with discipline,&amp;rdquo; it all started with an assignment from my professor about Google’s cookie and privacy policies. I was supposed to research how cookies influence ad targeting and how collected privacy data is processed, stored and used.

ABSTRACT
We analyze the welfare consequences of a monopolist having additional information about consumers’ tastes, beyond the prior distribution; the additional information can be used to charge different prices to different segments of the market, i.e., carry out &amp;ldquo;third degree price discrimination.&amp;rdquo; We show that the segmentation and pricing induced by the additional information can achieve every combination of consumer and producer surplus such that: (i) consumer sur- plus is nonnegative, (ii) producer surplus is at least as high as profits under the uniform monopoly price, and (iii) total surplus does not exceed the surplus generated by efficient trade.</description>

      <description>Wall Street Journal has its take on Google&amp;rsquo;s dicey cookie policy. Let&amp;rsquo;s wait for a while for the dust to fall:
Google Is Keeping Cookies in Chrome After All By Patience Haggin and Suzanne Vranica
Original new article here.
In a major reversal, Google is ending a plan to eliminate cookies in its Chrome browser after four years of efforts, delays and disagreements with the advertising industry.
The decision to keep the pervasive tracking technology known as “cookies” in Chrome comes after a series of setbacks, as both digital-advertising companies and regulators objected to the plan and to Google’s proposed replacement technologies.</description>

      <description>Taking the premise that there is privacy issue with Cookies—some sacrifice between efficiency and privacy is inevitable.
How does the industry react: Browsers:
Some browsers take an extreme approach: Safari and Firefox has been blocking Cookies for years. While others are more moderate: Edge doesn&amp;rsquo;t block 3rd party cookies.
Regulator:
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) initiated in Europe provides comprehensive privacy or data protection reform for not only European residents and European companies, but all companies worldwide that are serving customers in Europe—including consent for users to opt-in using personal Cookie data.</description>

      <description>We will focus on Google Chrome to discuss 3rd party cookies&amp;rsquo; value in online advertising. Because (i) Cookie and privacy policies vary among browsers, and Chrome is the most popular web-browser (91.56% global share, according 6sense&amp;rsquo;s report) (ii) Google announced their plan in replacing 3rd party cookies in 2025 (iii) The Ad-exchange industry, whose value largely depends on Cookies, accounts for 10% of Google&amp;rsquo;s revenue.
The Ad-Exchange Industry Structure Publishers like the NY Times attract readers and sell ad space to third-party ad exchanges, which collect user information through cookies and sell it to advertisers.</description>

      <description>Let’s take a musical detour. Ariana Grande’s “No Tears Left to Cry” isn’t just a pop hit; it’s a message of healing and care, mirroring the core of her album Sweetener. Directed by Dave Meyers, one of the industry’s top music video directors, the song’s visuals are as uplifting as its lyrics. So, as Ariana says, &amp;ldquo;pickin&amp;rsquo; it up&amp;rdquo;—join me in a brief musical escape from the daily grind of books, papers, and assignments, and keep writing&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;This piece is short, exciting-and audiences love it. I like the way the medieval Dies Irae plainchant theme shows up: first very quietly on the piano (in Variation 7), and then marching (in Variation 10) before it goes off-beat and jazzy. And listen to the way the harmony changes before it opens up into the famous 18th Variation, in which the main theme is turned upside down. The last Variation, No.</description>

      <description>Rachmaninov&amp;rsquo;s music, with its deep, exquisite melancholy, reflects the profound empathy of the composer&amp;rsquo;s artistic transformative power, to be turned into pure artistic beauty.
I am listening to a lot of Rachmaninov&amp;rsquo;s music these days. I found it useful (and somehow, even necessary) to know a bit of the composer&amp;rsquo;s background to better understand the music.
One convenient way is Apple Music Classical&amp;rsquo;s professional annotations—writers carefully crafts introductions for a composer in general, for his works, for particular recordings&amp;hellip; In-depth, organized and systematic sources.</description>

      <description>When I listended to Rachmaninov&amp;rsquo;s piano concerto no.2 (during one morning makeup routine)—2nd movement Adagio—I found it surprisingly similar to the pre-chorus of Celine Dion&amp;rsquo;s hit All by Myself. Turned out, that Rachmaninov&amp;rsquo;s most popular piece is a pop song.
Rach&amp;rsquo;s most popular piece is actually All by Myself, as he is officially a co-writer.
Rachmaninov Op. 18 | Piano Concerto No. 2 This C Minor masterpiece is dedicated to Nikolai Dahl, the Paris-trained amateur viola player and physician who, with a series of daily therapy sessions over a period of months, helped Rachmaninoff climb out of his depression.</description>

      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;Penn Faces&amp;rdquo; originates from the University of Pennsylvania. It refers to the phenomenon where students maintain a facade of happiness and success, even if they are struggling internally. This facade creates an impression that everyone around them is doing well, which can lead to feelings of isolation and inadequacy for those who are struggling but don&amp;rsquo;t want to show it. The constant pressure to appear perfect exacerbates stress, anxiety, and depression.</description>

      <description>Regulation restricts the action of economic agents—in general. It is omnipresent. Why does regulation exist? In a free-market economy, why does the government choose to place restrictions on the decisions of certain agents and actions?
George Stigler (1911-1991) introduced his &amp;ldquo;Theory of Economic Regulation&amp;rdquo; in 1971 trying to answer this question in a well-established framework, on the basis of some previous empirical arguments such as Normative Analysis as a Positive Theory (NPT) or Capture Theory (CT).</description>

      <description>June 18, The Royal Ballet presented three of Ashton&amp;rsquo;s most celebrated and expertly choreographed pieces set to music by Mendelssohn, Rachmaninoff and Auber.
This mixed programme opens with the buoyant Les Rendezvous, a fizzing succession of dances following a group of friends who meet in a park. The Dream, Ashton’s witty and tender reimagining of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer’s Night Dream, follows set to Felix Mendelssohn’s gossamer light music. The one-act ballet follows two pairs of mortal lovers, their fates at the hands of Oberon and Titania, the King and Queen of Fairies.</description>

In a Stackelberg Security Game, a defender commits to a randomized deployment of security resources, and an attacker best responds by attacking a target that maximizes their utility. While algorithms for computing an optimal strategy for the defender to commit to have been used in several real-world applications, deployed applications require knowledge about the utility function of the potential attacker.</description>

      <description>Communicate in English is one thing, using English as a foreign language in professional academic setting is completely another level of difficulty. I&amp;rsquo;m taking Oral Presentation, (EFSLANG 691S) this summer at Stanford, which is a course designed for advanced graduate students to practice in academic presentation skills.
At the very beginning of the course, the first introductory slide introduces four questions that relates with almost the deepest starting point of presentations, along with my thinkings</description>

Some of my friends stayed in the Bay area. Got together to have coffee or dinner and talk with them–it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how our state of minds evolve over time.
Some things never change though. Coincidentally, two of the friends recommended me two piece of music.</description>

      <description>A friend in Stanford recommended the 2nd moment of Mozart Symphony No.40 in G minor to me.
&amp;ldquo;It was a good waltz&amp;rdquo;, he said. Well, it is arguably one of Mozart&amp;rsquo;s most famous symphony pieces. Listen here for its infamous first movement Molto allegro.
But the second movement (listen here) is not necessarily the best dancable waltz. For waltz music that actually intended for dance, one should go for Tchaikovsky&amp;rsquo;s ballet suites, they have the perfect tempo and momentum for dances.</description>

China Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion in Landmark Antitrust Case The penalty is the biggest move to date in China’s campaign to tighten supervision of its internet Goliaths.

But sometimes being too occupied drowns oneself. I will find myself staring at the computer screen with something displaying yet my mind simply does not work. The delicate balance of being active and burnt out is something that shall not be taken for granted.
Already feeling losing a bit of control over life, here&amp;rsquo;s some minimal effort of taking it back––the list of to-read papers and priorities that should be on the top of my mind.</description>

      <description>How to have great conversations? (see here for a review) One simple trick is to be a good listener. The intention of self-expression roots deeply in our humanity. So viewing this from the other side: the more you listen, the more the other will feel seen––even, sometimes what you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing is simply repeating the last few words of what they&amp;rsquo;d said.
&amp;lsquo;Mute&amp;rsquo; is the technique though, but not an omnipotent solution.</description>

In Part 1 of this two-part conversation with the extraordinarily prolific Ariana Grande, the crew has a wide ranging conversation on childhood, Ariana’s Broadway origins, and getting to act alongside her best friends. Ariana shares thoughtful reflections on her time at Nickelodeon and why therapy should be mandatory for all child actors.
Though mostly filled with casual chats and laughter, there&amp;rsquo;s an astoundingly beautiful intepretation of Saturn&amp;rsquo;s ring in the episode.</description>

You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
You hit like my biggest fan when I hear what the critiques say
You hit just like a green light when I&amp;rsquo;m stuck runnin&amp;rsquo; real late

      <description>Supposedly, Mozart once made a joke:
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s worse than the sound of a flute? - Two flutes.&amp;rdquo;
We&amp;rsquo;ll never know if it is real. Somehow anecdotally humors turned into being that Mozart hated the flute. But, when one listens to his flute and harp concerto, this seems hard to believe anyway.
But it&amp;rsquo;s true that Mozart seldom offer to write works for flute alone. He said so himself, in a letter to his father.</description>

Following Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s eternal sunshine release in March, Taylor Swift&amp;rsquo;s tenth album in April, Dua Lipa in May. And now Sabrina Carpenter has taken over to begin her campaign for her new project Short n&amp;rsquo; Sweet.
Sabrina Carpenter’s latest single looks to take her breakout year to an even-higher level. Her season is in full effect. As “Espresso” continues to dominate, “Please Please Please,” the second single from Carpenter’s forthcoming Short n’ Sweet LP, has emerged as yet another smash for the pint-sized pop star.</description>

      <description>The Beta distribution is a versatile and useful probability distribution with a wide range of applications in statistics, particularly when associated with modelling unknown probabilities and doing Bayesian inference. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview:
definition The Beta distribution, denoted as $ \theta \sim B(\alpha, \beta) $​, is defined by two shape parameters $ \alpha $​ and $ \beta $​. The probability density function (pdf) of the Beta distribution is given by: $$ f(\theta) = \frac{\theta^{\alpha - 1}(1 - \theta)^{\beta - 1}}{\int_0^1 x^{\alpha - 1}(1 - x)^{\beta - 1} dx} $$ where $ \theta $​ lies in the interval $[0, 1]$​.</description>

      <description>There are three major shopping festivals in China: double eleven (Nov. 11), double twelve (Dec. 12) and 6.18. It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat akin to Black Friday yet still slightly different. All these three festivals emerged in the past decade, and are promoted mainly by E-commerce platforms. They are basically artificial festivals tailored for consumerism.
Naturally (though still interesting and enjoyable to observe and experience), when online platforms started to offer huge discounts, local retail stores simultaneously begin to offer discounts.</description>

      <description>The song casts a magical spell. The first line of the chorus, with the lyric &amp;rsquo;the boy is mine&amp;rsquo;, masterfully escalates the tension built up from the pre-chorus––however though, by disrupting the tension&amp;rsquo;s anticipating flow, with a striking and beautiful fermata on the tempo. This innovative technique, rarely seen in recent pop productions, perfectly ignites the song’s whimsical and provocative allure.

This song is a collaboration with her then-boyfriend Mac Miller, and it famously includes the line, &amp;ldquo;I got a bad boy, you must admit it.&amp;rdquo; Her subsequent albums—My Everything and Dangerous Woman—further shaped her image as a love-craving icon.

At each time point, a task $k$ out of $K$ possible tasks arrives randomly with probability $f_k$, and the platform must decide whom to notify (activate) based on the likelihood of acceptance $p_{k, i}, i\in [N]$ and the potential reward for each volunteer incentivized, exogeneously given as $w_k$.</description>

      <description>Consider an RMAB instance with $N$ arms, where each arm $i \in [N]$ has a finite state space $\mathbb S_i$ and can receive an action $y_i^t \in {0, 1}$ (representing not pulling or pulling the arm, respectively) at each time step $t$. The state of arm $i$ at time $t$ is denoted by $s_i^t$. Depending on the action taken, a reward $r_i(s_i^t, y_i^t)$ is accrued. As a decision maker, our objective is to maximize the averaged total reward over an infinite time horizon, under a constraint that only $B$ arms can be pulled at any time step.</description>

      <description>Decision-making in dynamic environments over time presents unique challenges, particularly when the conditions influencing decisions are constantly changing. In such scenarios, traditional decision-making models often fall short. This is where Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMAB) come into play. The method provides a robust framework for modeling and optimizing decisions over time. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief introduction of the concept of RMAB and the Whittle Index Policy.

Keys: random product offering/demand allocation/pricing algorithm.
TALK ABSTRACT: First, we study blind boxes as a novel selling mechanism in which buyers purchase sealed packages containing unknown items, with the chance of uncovering rare or special items. We show how such product randomization introduced by the blind box can improve the seller’s profitability over traditional separate selling. Second, we study how an e-commerce platform should assign sequentially arriving customers to sellers who compete to sell identical products on the platform.</description>

TALK ABSTRACT: New prescription drugs require regulatory approval before drug makers can sell them. In some countries, regulators may conditionally approve a drug, which allows sales to begin before the developer has proven the drug&amp;rsquo;s efficacy. After further testing, the regulator may either grant final approval or reject the drug. We show that conditional approval not only speeds access to drugs but also encourages the development of drugs that would not have been pursued otherwise.</description>

TALK ABSTRACT: To study the limits of personalization, we introduce the notion of a clairvoyant firm that can read the mind of consumers and sell them the highest revenue product that they are willing to buy. We show how to compute the expected revenue of the clairvoyant firm for a class of rational discrete choice models, and develop prophet-type inequalities that provide performance guarantees for the expected revenue of the traditional assortment optimization firm (a TAOP firm) relative to the clairvoyant firm, and therefore to any effort to personalize assortments.</description>

      <description>Andante cantabile(It.) is a direction often used by composers. In general, it means flowing and songlike.
The andante tempo is known as the walking pace, and the pacing and energy should generally feel like a nice stroll.
Cantabile [kanˈtaːbile], an Italian word, means literally &amp;ldquo;singable&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;songlike&amp;rdquo;. In instrumental music, it is a particular style of playing designed to imitate the human voice.
To a large section of the public, however, it means one work, the 2nd movt.</description>

In the highly competitive coffee market, a fierce price war erupted with the introduction of the ¥9.9 (~1.37USD) coffee, leading to dramatic changes for two major players: COTTI Coffee and luckin Coffee. Over the span of a year, this aggressive pricing strategy have caused COTTI&amp;rsquo;s slowing down in its pace of expansion, while luckin Coffee also saw its profits plummet, transitioning from profitability to significant losses.

      <description>A two-day series on Lieder
Today I had the privilege of attending a concert curated and performed by Changyong Liao, alongside his long-time collaborator, German pianist Hartmut Höll. The duo masterfully arranged a series of Lieder (aka, art songs) titled Three Wishes of the Rose: 16 Chinese Lieders. Witnessing these original composers interpret these songs was a profound experience, filled with a rich tapestry of emotions and beauty.

      <description>Lieder in a nutshell The plural German noun Lieder (singular Lied) simply means “songs” – any kind of songs. But for classical music enthusiasts, the word signifies songs with piano accompaniment circa 1800–1900 – the birth of the form which coincided with the rise of the poetry-enjoying European middle classes in the wake of the French Revolution.

Lieder represents perhaps the most expressive sub-genre within classical music.</description>

      <description>Working as a teaching assistant for college mathematics or general mathematically inclined courses turns out to be not as trivial a task as I&amp;rsquo;ve thought it to be. This semester I&amp;rsquo;m TAing for Advanced Optimization –– an obligatory course for sophomore students. I&amp;rsquo;ve also took last year. Moreover, I took an even more advanced version of it (convex optimization) while I was visiting Stanford last summer. Still, teaching and tutoring turns out not to be something that comes out of thin air.</description>

      <description>Dynamic Programming (DP) serves as a foundational approach in computational algorithms, especially effective in environments with complete knowledge of state transitions and rewards, described within the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. However, the real-world often presents scenarios where such comprehensive information is unavailable. Here, Reinforcement Learning (RL) steps in with model-free methods that leverage DP principles but operate without the need for explicit transition probabilities or rewards.
Markov Decision Process (MDP) Framework An MDP is a mathematical framework used to describe an environment in decision-making problems where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.</description>

      <description>Gather around for some bedtime tales from the beautiful land of the free market. Here are four classical antitrust-collusion economic stories.
communication problems Once upon a time, in February 1982, the CEO of American Airlines, Robert Crandall, found price competition too fierce in the airline industry. He called Howard Putnam, the CEO of Braniff Airlines, to share his thoughts. Little did he know that Putnam was recording the conversation:
Crandall: I think it’s dumb as hell for Christ’s sake, all right, to sit here and pound the **** out of each other and neither one of us making a ****ing dime.</description>

      <description>Definition Overture is a music instrumental introduction to a ballet or opera. During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn composed overtures which were independent, self-existing, instrumental, programmatic works that foreshadowed genres such as the symphonic poem. In motion pictures, an overture is a piece of music setting the mood for the film before the opening credits start.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of my favourite overtures. Ranked w.r.t. listening frequency:</description>

      <description>My impression of Shostakovich used to be largely biased with his chromaticism–the squeakily sharp Symphony No. 1 and the rich underlying emotions embodied in Symphony No. 5, as Apple Music Classical introduced
His Symphony No. 5 (1937) and subsequent works express a fury and despair that he could not voice in public, although these works were often leavened with moments of sarcasm, irony, and cheeky allusions to his own private life.</description>

      <description>In 1889, when Tchaikovsky was 49 years old and at the height of his fame and powers, he composed his ballet The Sleeping Beauty–based on a romantic fairy tale. An elaborate waltz is performed and Princess Aurora arrives:
No.6 Grande valse villageoise (a.k.a. The Garland Waltz)
Undeniably, Tchaikovsky wrote the best waltz music. This waltz is just as popular as other Tchaikovsky classics, as well as the ballet suite–people hear it in Disney movie music tracks, Tom and Jerry, restaurants, and even elevators.</description>

      <description>Ariana Grande graced the 2024 Met Gala not merely as a guest but as a spellbinding performer under the grandeur of the Met’s storied arches. Clothed in a sheer green gown by Maison Margiela, designed by John Galliano, Grande radiated an ethereal charm. The gown, a diaphanous masterpiece, clung to her like morning dew, catching the light in a cascade of shimmering greens that seemed to paint her in the colors of a waking forest.</description>

      <description>Happy Sunday! Today, I’m stepping away from the antitrust series to explore a lighter topic: deadlines–—the last-minute scrambles that somehow keep our world spinning.
Somehow I noticed that people like to procrastinate until the very last minute–sometimes the action seems plausible while some doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Here&amp;rsquo;s some observation. Join me as we unpack the economics behind the ticking clock in our daily lives.

      <description>ECONOMICS OF REGULATION AND ANTITRUST by W. Viscusi, Joseph Harrington Jr. and David Sappington
Chapter 3 Introduction of Antitrust | Reading Write-Ups
Introduction: The Value of Studying Antitrust The essence of economics vibrates with the spirit of competition. While not utterly unconstrained—no, firms can&amp;rsquo;t simply dynamite their competitors&amp;rsquo; facilities—we lean on competition as the quintessential engine driving favorable economic outcomes. But sometimes competition evaporates. Essentially, antitrust laws strive to enhance market functionality by nurturing and regulating competition.</description>

      <description>TA Notes | Problem solving session for Advanced Operational Research, taught at SUFE 2024 Spring/Summer semester.
Inspiration taken from EE364a I took 2023 Summer at Stanford.
There are basically three ways to establish convexity of a function $f$:
verify definition (rarely used)
if $f$ is twice-differentiable, show $\nabla^2f(x) \succeq 0 $​
NOTE: only recommended for simple enough functions. a function is simple enough iff. it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;manual-computationally tractable&amp;rsquo; for you</description>

      <description>The original Chinese version of Nocturnal Narratives:
《选妃》
不敢说博学，但我蛮喜欢读书的：因为晚上做题， 解题目到了兴头上容易失眠，床头就得常放着一两本书，睡前翻两页，也就有困意了。
选书也有技巧。太有趣不行。之前从书店买了套阿西莫夫的小说集，好几本。读到《神们自己》， 以为还是短篇集，每一晚上读几篇，可多可少，困了就睡。结果这本是中长篇，写的还不错，忍不住一口气看完，天就快亮了。
太硬也不行。有一次选了范里安的《微观经济学现代观点》，实在是太抽象。索性躺在床上发呆，又想起来刚刚没解出来的题，更睡不着了。
内容还有讲究。蔡澜的散文和杂文很合适，但他的美食评论是坚决不能睡前看的，写的太好。
最后，也会强迫自己多少读读哲学和心理学的书， 我不喜欢，但经不住朋友喜欢，还乐意借给我。不过这些书最催眠，也就爱屋及乌了。
住在宿舍不比家中舒适。但每天挑书陪睡，像翻牌子。常告诚自己少专宠，要雨露均沾，要节制，不要在新欢旧爱之间觉得力不从心一一要早点睡。</description>

Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992) is Argentina’s most famous musical name—the man who has almost single-handedly brought the passion, thrill and beauty of the tango to a worldwide audience. Would the composer and bandoneon player have been able to achieve this without years of studying in Paris with the great Nadia Boulanger?</description>

      <description>Plants vs. Zombies (2009), crafted by PopCap, is more than just a game. Sure, I could wax technical about how it’s essentially a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a tightly defined set of actions and stochastic outcomes. But really, it’s about strategic greenery and quirky zombies invading your lawn in an oddly delightful dance of sunlight and survival.
If I frame it as an MDP, I might sound nerdy&amp;hellip; Just kidding, the game is a blast.</description>

Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion ABSTRACT
Consider sellers in a competitive market that use algorithms to adapt their prices from data that they collect. In such a context it is plausible that algorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices and this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.</description>

      <description>In the simplified Chinese internet community that consisted of social platforms and general E-commerce platforms, Little Red Book (Xiao Hong Shu) stands out as the Chinese Instagram.
The app, which is based on the popular book of the same name, focuses on user-generated content, mostly in the area of fashion, beauty, and lifestyle.
Little Red Book app’s target demographic is mostly urban women aged 18 to 35 years old. The app started as a product review platform, where users were looking for luxury fashion and beauty products from overseas as well share their latest shopping tips with others on board.</description>

      <description>Consider a decision problem where you have a collection of $\mathcal L$ papers to read before your next week&amp;rsquo;s meeting with your advisor. For each paper $l \in \mathcal L$, you can estimate its relevance and quality, represented as a potential intellectual reward $r_i$, modeled by a probability distribution $F_i(\cdot)$. $r_i$&amp;rsquo;s value is only learnt and acquired after you thoroughly read through the paper. Additionally, each paper comes with an uncertain reading time $t_i$, modeled by another distribution $G_i(\cdot)$.</description>

      <description>Christie&amp;rsquo;s latest story Everything you need to know about Impressionism: how a group of rebel artists &amp;lsquo;freed painting&amp;rsquo; offered a thorough, concise and informative introduction of the origin of impressionism. Coincidentally, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of Impressionism, the upcoming 20th Century Evening Sale (16, May 2024) features the presentation of Monet&amp;rsquo;s seminal painting, Moulin de Limetz, from The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and the Heirs of Ethel B. Atha, accompanied by a few other exquisite examples by the artists who paved the way for the birth of 20th Century Art.</description>

      <description>Three days following Taylor Swift&amp;rsquo;s release of her 31-track new album The Tortured Poets Department / The Anthology, Pitchfork released their reviews that rated 6.6 / 6 for the first and second half of the album, respectively.
I believe writing the Pitchfork review of a Taylor Swift album should earn you the medal of freedom for your courage.
–– Louie @DJLouieXIV, X
Swifties quickly flooded the comment section under Pitchfork&amp;rsquo;s twitter post–speaking any slightest negativity unanonymously against the most passionate and gigantic fan base on earth requires extra courage and care.</description>

      <description>My advisor was somehow less enthusiastic in information design as compared to other general algorithm game theory topics–despite my several failed attempts to lure him into doing some related projects. But his major concern is solid, that information design demands overly strong assumptions–the existence of a common prior, commitment of the signal sender, inference ability of the signal receiver–all poses challenges for direct applications that justify the existing theory. The real world should be something in between the perfectly rational Bayesian persuasion and the noisy cheap talks.</description>

      <description>The first time I encountered the name &amp;ldquo;Daniel Kahneman&amp;rdquo; was in a behavioral economics class, where we were introduced to his seminal 1979 Econometrica paper on &amp;ldquo;prospect theory.&amp;rdquo; Initially, I pigeonholed him as an economist—a label he might not dispute, given his significant contributions to the interdisciplinary field of experimental economics, which bridges psychology and economics and has been instrumental in the development of behavioral economics.
However, Daniel Kahneman is perhaps more a psychologist than an economist.</description>

      <description>Previously, we discussed the challenges faced by apple farmers in ShaanXi, China (see the sweet and sour of apples and cranberries), that the farmers battle against the fluctuating price by strategically storing apple inventories so as to sell later, yet their decisions are far from optimal that brings regret and misfortune that sabotages the families&amp;rsquo; living business. My initial thought was that the problem belongs to market failures, that potential solutions lies in redesigning the selling mechanism and boost information transparency etc.</description>

      <description>unpacking solvers: streamlining complexity Solvers are advanced software tools designed to process specific mathematical programs and deliver solutions, like a linear programming solver. When juxtaposed with algorithms—which are methods crafted for distinct problems—solvers operate on a broader spectrum, targeting classes of problems rather than individual cases.
This abstraction not only boosts their flexibility but also their application across industries. Solvers enable a division of labor that heightens efficiency. Industry specialists focus on refining models to encapsulate real-world complexities, while solvers handle the computational tasks.</description>

playground Let ${Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n}$ be a collection of independent and identically sampled random variables out of $f(y; \theta)$, where $\theta \in \Theta$ is a (possibly unknown) parameter associated with the distribution. In general, we want to estimate $\theta$ using our samples $Y$. An estimation of $\theta$ - random variable $W$ can be expressed as $$ W = h(Y_1, \ldots, Y_n) $$</description>

      <description>Marianela Nunez&amp;rsquo;s rendition Kitri in The Royal Ballet&amp;rsquo;s production of Don Quixote is amazing. Kitri, if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, is the lead character in Don Quixote&amp;rsquo;s ballet-adjusted version. She embodies the Mediterranean dream of men: a flirtive, sexy and charismatic matured woman in her signature red dress.
The first time I watched it I was in awe. After almost infinite replays I came to realize that Nela&amp;rsquo;s Kitri is by far the most nuanced classical artistic performance I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.</description>

      <description>Prof. Yi Xiong&amp;rsquo;s Frontiers in Management Science Session covered a crash course on online learning and multi-armed bandits (MAB). A simple way to view MAB is to consider it as a tool to model and study online learning problems. At time $t$, a decision maker chooses an &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; or arm $i_t\in \mathcal I$ ($\mathcal I$ is the known set of distributions). The chosen machine returns a random reward $r_t$ following its distribution $Q_t$.</description>

      <description>Take Five is a jazz standard (i.e. a jazz song that has a rich history of being interpreted and reinterpreted), first recorded in 1959 and is the third track on Time Out by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. The song is in quintuple $5/4$ time, and this is where it got its name.

In Summer, Frozen (2013).
Summer holds a cherished place in the hearts of Chinese people.

The song exudes the typical Ed Sheeran bar-dance-music vibe, but with a twist. Camila adds a dash of Cuban flavor, while Cardi B brings her characteristic playfulness to the mix.</description>

      <description>In choosing between issuing a 1-billion loan to one massive state-owned enterprise or lending 1 million to a thousand smaller companies, most would prefer the first option as it seems more convenient and reliable. However, Zhejiang Tailong Commercial Bank (TaiLong Bank) takes the less-traveled path – the bank provides financial services to small-and-micro-enterprises (SMEs). Since its inception, the bank has cumulatively provided over ¥150 billion (around $23 billion) in loans, with an average loan size of ¥500,000, to its clientele, over 90% of whom are peasants-turned-entrepreneurs.</description>

the red of the gloves, paired with the innocent white dress, echoes a juxtaposition of passion and purity. meanwhile The dark background augments the sense of mesmerizing self-revelation.
Instead of directly replicating the color palette from the album cover, I decided to take a more conceptual approach, in reflecting the commitment to an ethereal minimalism—like, an homage to the what Saturn Return brings into our lives.</description>

Because if we&amp;rsquo;ve just been sort of relying on our cleverness, or relying, you know, just kind of floating along&amp;hellip; Saturn comes along and hits you over the head, and says, &amp;ldquo;Wake up&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s time for you to get real about life And sort out who you really are.</description>

      <description>My favourite so far, for Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s new album eternal sunshine is its intro (end of the world). Every intro of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s album is insanely beautiful. She tends to use softer instruments (especially strings) to company her voice, which leave space for her vocal showcase. For example, the intro of My Everything is almost as dreamy as falling into the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s star dusts. Not to mention the iconic 30-seconds solo acapella raindrops (an angel cried) of Sweetener.</description>

      <description>My mother is a doctor and leads the obstetrics department at a major hospital. Managing such a busy department, with over a hundred staff members, is a challenging task. In recent years, administrative responsibilities in healthcare management have become increasingly complex, that I can observe a significant surge in her phone call frequency. In 2019, new official guidelines for public hospital performance evaluation were introduced, leading to an annual grading campaign.</description>

      <description>Introducing the zero-sum competition system of the business world into healthcare, education, and many other industries that are far more complex than mere data, is nothing short of pathological.
For the following days, I will dive into a reported pitfall of the current medical evaluation system. In China, the performance of public hospitals are largely evaluated on their CMI index–over a uniform standards across different departments.
This seemingly convenient approach results in distorted incentives, chaos management and complaints.</description>

      <description>In the curious world of TaoBao, China&amp;rsquo;s e-commerce giant, I stumbled upon what can only be described as a &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; cleverly masquerading as a bug. Once in a while, TaoBao hosts what’s known as the &amp;ldquo;cross-seller price-break discount.&amp;rdquo; In theory, this sounds like a standard promotional sale—spend a certain amount across various sellers, and voila, you snag a discount. For instance, rack up items totaling 300 yuan from participating sellers, and you’re treated to a 40 yuan discount.</description>

If the sun refuse to shine, baby would I still be your lover? Would you want me there?
– intro (end of the world)

      <description>&amp;ldquo;how can i tell if i&amp;rsquo;m in the right relationship?&amp;rdquo;
Posted on the very beginning of her album&amp;rsquo;s intro (end of the world), Ariana Grande took an album to answer this question properly, as a response to her past 2 years of discretely married then publicly divorced situationship-ly marriage.
Albert Camus once remarked, that dedicating two years to ponder over a problem is entirely worthy. True art transcends mere wallowing in addictive emotions, be they sorrowful or euphoric.</description>

      <description>Ariana Grande is a paragon of aesthetic and disposition that I strive to emulate. Her music has been a constant companion, resonating with me on levels I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully comprehend in my youth. Initially, I was captivated by the surface beauty of her melodies and the power of her voice, but as I matured, I began to appreciate the depth of her lyrical prowess, the intricate vocal layers and the intentionality behind her artistry.</description>

      <description>Ariana Grande possesses a magnetic energy that attracts literally everything–from musical excellence to (possibly undesired) publicity. Among her songs, &amp;ldquo;just like magic&amp;rdquo; stands out as a testament to awe-inspiring confidence:
Just like magic, I&amp;rsquo;m attractive
I get everything I want cause I attract them.
There&amp;rsquo;s a fine line between positive self-assurance and complacency. With her four-octave range and Mariah Carey-like whistle note capacity, Ariana Grande has never lacked a &amp;ldquo;hear-me-roar&amp;rdquo; attitude, reminiscent of &amp;rsquo;90s divas.</description>

Living under possibly the most draconian public scrutiny, Ariana Grande steered through the tumulous years of her rising music career accompanied by a terrorist attack during tour, several relationship melt downs, meanwhile delivered two of the best albums—and one of the highest-grossing tours—of 2018 and 2019.

      <description>Thank U, Next got two seats out of the top-10 list. One is imagine, the other is needy.
I do hate overly simple songs: cloying melodies consisted of banal, unimaginative motifs and too-obvious intentions are absolutely unforgivable. Referring the words of a professor&amp;rsquo;s architecture appreciation course I&amp;rsquo;ve taken two years ago, &amp;ldquo;sometimes overly obvious &amp;lsquo;signs&amp;rsquo; or too straightforward expressions, despite appealing, are degrading for art.&amp;rdquo;
BUT &amp;mdash;- despite having shallow melodies (that one can literally anticipate the whole song after hearing the first few bars), needy sits on top of the list being simplicitly expressive and truthful.</description>

      <description>As the opening track of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s tumultuous album Thank U, Next, &amp;ldquo;imagine&amp;rdquo; sets the tone with mesmerizing minimalism. Listen here. This official music video of imagine features mosaiced icebergs melting to fall. The song gives an impression of a breathtakingly beautiful abstract painting, when one looks more carefully, there is so much pain tangled within.
Imagine is an absolute masterpiece that particularly, adds depth to the album&amp;rsquo;s artistry. It employs a steady triple meter and firm beats to elegantly propel the flow forward.</description>

Get well soon (stylized in all lowercase) is the fifteenth and final track from Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s fourth studio album, Sweetener. The track is 5 minutes and 22 seconds long, paying respect to the Manchester bombing attack at Ariana’s concert on the 22nd of May 2017. There&amp;rsquo;s 40 seconds of silence at the end of the track, to commemorate those who lost their lives during the attack.</description>

      <description>In the musical Hamilton (2015), in the song Satisfied, the rap verse, Angelica sang three reasons, literally &amp;ldquo;number one/two/three, &amp;hellip;blah blah&amp;rdquo; to illustrate why she loved but cannot marry Alexander Hamilton and she backed up for her sister. It was possibly the most unimaginatively boring lyrics ever written.
That is to say, when it comes to music, aside from serious discuss of production quality, vocal techniques or more general analysis, sometimes what matters most is appeals and feelings.</description>

The title track of Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s fourth studio album &amp;ldquo;sweetener&amp;rdquo; (stylized in all lowercase) the pivotal nomination in my top-10 Ariana Grande list. This album, Sweetener, won Grande a Grammy. The artist herself has elucidated the essence of the album&amp;rsquo;s title, suggesting it&amp;rsquo;s an ode to the act of illuminating one&amp;rsquo;s existence or circumstances, metaphorically &amp;ldquo;sweetening&amp;rdquo; life&amp;rsquo;s myriad challenges:
it&amp;rsquo;s kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone&amp;rsquo;s life or somebody else brings light to your life.</description>

      <description>One, two three&amp;hellip; c&amp;rsquo;om, girls!
Focus is an Ariana Grande single yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to any of her studio albums:
The song was originally released as the lead single from Grande&amp;rsquo;s third studio album, titled Moonlight at the time. As the album&amp;rsquo;s concept changed and its title renamed to become Dangerous Woman, the song was removed from the main track list, including the standard and deluxe versions. In this process, &amp;ldquo;Dangerous Woman&amp;rdquo; replaced &amp;ldquo;Focus&amp;rdquo; as the lead single.</description>

The first is &amp;ldquo;The Way&amp;rdquo;, and the other is &amp;ldquo;Tattooed Heart&amp;rdquo;. While &amp;ldquo;The Way&amp;rdquo; was an immediate hit upon release, &amp;ldquo;Tattooed Heart&amp;rdquo; gained recognition more gradually, especially after Grande performed it frequently in her later career, notably during her Sweetener World Tour.
The setlist of the Sweetener World Tour was strategically divided into three sections.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s just a binary question with at most four combination of answer, but it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to give a simple, definite response or even directly confront the truth for some people. Here&amp;rsquo;s one answer from Ariana Grande though, in her Vogue 19 cover interview</description>

      <description>Recently, China&amp;rsquo;s primary, stable, all-in-one, state-railway-bureau-directly-operated official railway ticketing platform, 12306, announced an expansion into the airline ticket market. This move is not expected to reduce airfare costs directly, yet it signifies a notable shift in the competitive landscape for Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like CTrip, potentially impacting their market share and profitability.
Understanding the mechanics of airline ticket sales is crucial here. Airlines set their flight schedules, seat pricing, and then distribute this information through a Global Distribution System (GDS).</description>

The attitude expressed by Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s billboard interview (almost 9 years ago) pretty much reflected this pov:

It reminded me of Moonlight by Ariana Grande from her third album Dangerous Woman. It&amp;rsquo;s just an elegant, gorgeous love ballad. According to Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s Wiki:
Victoria Monét (Grande&amp;rsquo;s producer-slash-bestie) said &amp;ldquo;[&amp;lsquo;Moonlight&amp;rsquo;,] that’s what Ricky [Alvarez, Grande&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend then] called her one night.</description>

– breathin
Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;breathin,&amp;rdquo; the ninth track from her 2018 album Sweetener, stands as a quintessential pop anthem. Despite its conventional ABABCB song structure and the use of familiar chord progressions and motifs, the track has resonated deeply with a broad audience, many of whom regard it as a highlight of the album.
While the song&amp;rsquo;s pop sensibilities might seem overly straightforward to some, its lyrical depth and the uplifting nature of its theme offer a surprising layer of relatability.</description>

      <description>Music exists at the sublime confluence of mathematics and artistry, embodying a synergy that elevates both disciplines. The essence of music theory, particularly in the analysis of chords, mirrors an advanced form of modular arithmetic, showcasing a mathematical elegance. Musical scores serve as encoded scripts of melodies, awaiting decryption and performance. Particularly, Johann Sebastian Bach epitomizes this blend of mathematical intricacy and artistic beauty, standing as a paragon of the fusion between the two realms.</description>

      <description>I prefer writing in all lowercases–especially devoid of conventional capitalizations of the first letters. First learnt this in Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s Sweetener album tracks&amp;rsquo; all-lowercase namings and initially trying just for fun, I found this way of styled writing extremely comfortable so that it eventually forms into a habit. This seemingly personal preference however, coincides with a latest trend of writing style, especially among Gen Z.
Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s iconic, abusive use of all-lowercase writings in her social media posts, do do her fans.</description>

      <description>The Spring Festival in-cinema movie market is a compelling subject for analysis. From a macro perspective, its structure transcends the basic two-sided model of buyers and sellers. This market encompasses multiple stakeholders: cinemas, filmmakers (including actors and directors) and their production companies, ticketing platforms, rating agencies, social media, and, crucially, the consumers themselves. These Spring-Festical films are typically produced months in advance, with release dates often aligned with the Spring Festival holidays.</description>

      <description>With Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day colliding with the fifth day of the Spring Festival, love is in the air, and economics is on the mind. Here are two tales where romance meets rationality.
The Economist’s cost-of-loving index Love, they say, is priceless. But let&amp;rsquo;s face it, showing off one&amp;rsquo;s financial prowess can be quite the love language in today&amp;rsquo;s material world. Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, in particular, turns into a veritable showcase of affection-measured-in-dollars. According to the National Retail Federation, the average American is expected to shell out $186 to woo their Valentine this year.</description>

      <description>A paper I read recently is somewhat interesting. The model is very inspiring for an OM project I&amp;rsquo;m working on recently, whereas its mathematical method and results are immensely useful to learn from for another problem that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while.
Is Selling Complete Information (Approximately) Optimal?
Dirk Bergemann, Yang Cai, Grigoris Velegkas, and Mingfei Zhao. 2022.
ABSTRACT
We study the problem of selling information to a data-buyer who faces a decision problem under uncertainty.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s blog draws inspiration from Michael D. Smith&amp;rsquo;s perspective on higher education, as discussed in a recent episode of the podcast People I (Mostly) Admire, titled &amp;ldquo;Higher Education Is Broken. Can It Be Fixed?&amp;rdquo; . Btw, the podcast itself is part of the Freakonomics network, the academically inclined perspective is particularly sweetspot for an econ student.
This episode elucidates the systemic flaws plaguing the U.S. higher education system. One pov involves diving into the market power of colleges.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading some papers about mechanism design on pricing of information, following up on this data trading reading session
Bergemann et al. (AER 2018): The Design and Price of Information. Bergemann et al. (EC 2022): Is Selling Completely Information (Approximately) Optimal? Bergemann et al. (EC 2015): Selling Cookies. Hopefully, I&amp;rsquo;ll finish them within this week. I have a strong feeling that they will be immensely interesting.
Before our discussion, a short notice: a review of numerous news posts and literature in econ-CS reveals a significant discrepancy between academic research on data trading in algorithmic game theory (AGT) and Econ-CS communities, and the evolving realities of the actual data trading market.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching on data trading. China established several state-owned data exchange centers (e.g. Shanghai Data Exchange) and they are gradually building momentum recently because of the generative-AI booming bubble. But it&amp;rsquo;s not a new thing. An early article &amp;lsquo;Data is giving rise to a new economy&amp;rsquo; sort of predicted the prosperous market seven years ago (The Economist, May 6th 2017).
Data are to this century what oil was to the last one: a driver of growth and change.</description>

      <description>Sabrina Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s hit Nonsense is a great song, both artistically and commercially. The song gives a &amp;ldquo;I-DONT-GIVE-A-SHIT&amp;rdquo; (IDGAS) energy. The singer herself said in Genius VERIFIED interview
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;we were hitting a lot of walls and we&amp;rsquo;re like, you know what, let&amp;rsquo;s just literally write nonsense, no joke. and that&amp;rsquo;s how the song happened.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;A lot of our justification for lyrics was well it&amp;rsquo;s nonsense. so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to make any sense at all and we just have fun.</description>

      <description>Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love Messi?
There is something mesmerising about his minimalism. He has stripped the game back to its essentials; his greatest gift has perhaps been his capacity to select the lowest-tariff option necessary in any given situation. There is an impish grace to everything he does on a pitch and yet his success is rooted in cold, unfussy calculation.
But recently, something other than pure football is all over the news.</description>

      <description>Following competition consequences I, part II about competition and repugnancy. A repugnant market refers to a market where certain goods or services are considered objectionable or morally unacceptable to buy and sell, despite there being potential buyers and sellers. Examples include markets for organs, surrogacy, and certain forms of labor. However, beyond moral objections, these markets raise additional concerns, as said in Al Roth&amp;rsquo;s Who Gets What and Why, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that:</description>

      <description>bridging concepts Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate the nuanced distinction between mechanism design and market design. Initially, I conflated the two, but a deeper dive into the subject matter—prompted by a friend&amp;rsquo;s bachelor thesis—has elucidated the critical differences.
Mechanism design is inherently algorithmic, centered around eliciting information and strategically manipulating incentives through mathematical formulations. It&amp;rsquo;s a toolset for creating environments where desired outcomes can be achieved based on the information asymmetries and strategic interactions of participants.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently stumbled across a photographer Chaoming Zeng (曾朝民) on instagram, whose base is also Guangdong China, but more in the rural area like Dong-guan. Here&amp;rsquo;s the particular work that really took my breath away:
All rights belong to the original photographer, @chaomingzeng. But, OMG, this picture is almost like an oil painting of modern misery juxtaposed with the mundane hope of life.
Personally, I am deeply attached to my hometown Guangzhou, of the vibrant yet chaotic essence, a raw, unpolished vitality that roots itself deeply in the everyday lives of its inhabitants.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a meme that perfectly captures the essence of understanding machine learning, a realization that dawned on me after enrolling in both machine learning and statistics courses. It highlights the intricate relationship between these fields in a humorous yet profound way:
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until taking both machine learning and stats courses to make me recall how accurate this meme is.
High Dimensional Statistics was an elective course I took last semester (Fall/Winter 2023-24) at SUFE, taught by Prof.</description>

      <description>Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m immersed in two mechanism design projects, both intricately involving the integration of stochastic processes within their frameworks. This reminds me of a comic that resonates humorously with my work:
An economist&amp;rsquo;s playful daydream or a mathematician&amp;rsquo;s practical joke, it&amp;rsquo;s a scenario where certainty is the only casualty and the pursuit of fairness takes a probabilistic turn. Prepare for a world where the accountants are the gamblers, and the odds are your tax bracket.</description>

      <description>I have taken courses in mathematical statistics, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and several optimization courses. Additionally, I am registered for an econometrics course next semester😱. So, like currently, it&amp;rsquo;s a stage where I have laid a strong theoretical foundation and possess a mastery of Python and R in data analysis, but my hands-on experience in tackling real-world problems is almost non-existent. After all, the datasets we used in class assignments are primarily toy examples that are cleaned, checked, and designed for specific tasks.</description>

SANCAN: Sonatine for Flute and Piano: I. Moderato [composer]: Pierre Sancan
[artist]: Emmanuel Pahud, Eric Le Sage.
[album]: Paris
Jan. 20, 1998. Parlophone Records Limited.
The opening 45 seconds of this piece are like a fog-draped dream. The piano strikes raindrops of notes on a misty, ethereal dreamscape, like cobblestoned street under the soft glow of a solitary streetlamp.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a carnival of groceries at the heart of the town, lively, a bit chaotic, and full of fruit stands. Each one offers a variety of fruits that seem similar but are unique in their quality and price.
I was looking for a specific local banana🍌, known for being budget-friendly yet deliciously sweet when ripe. I wandered from stall to stall, asking for it, but had no luck. The vendors kept steering me towards a different type of banana, claiming it was better – but it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted.</description>

Reflecting on my use of the app, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that it has significantly improved the classical music listening experience, making it more professional, smooth, and enjoyable.

      <description>According to Better Heath Channel
Mountain climbers are at risk of developing altitude sickness (also known as mountain sickness), which may be harmful or even fatal if its onset is ignored. It is caused by gaining altitude too rapidly, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow the body enough time to adjust to reduced oxygen and changes in air pressure, and causes hypobaric hypoxia (a lack of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body).</description>

      <description>In our digitally inter-connected era, platforms like Dianpin and Yelp have become integral to our decision-making process for choosing restaurants, hotels, and entertainment. These online rating platforms are revolutionizing the demand pattern hence revenue stream of service providers.
Basically, ratings platforms are to provision information. Service providers, from local bistros to boutique hotels, register themselves on these platforms. Consumers then rate these services, often accompanied by comments and photos. These ratings are the lifeblood of these platforms, determining how businesses are ranked and recommended to new users searching for, say, “nearby hotpot restaurants.</description>

Apple has long championed this feature, underscoring their commitment to user privacy. Apple&amp;rsquo;s marketing not only highlights Apple&amp;rsquo;s dedication to privacy but also subtly positions their products as trustworthy guardians of personal data.
However, I&amp;rsquo;ve also read about (although not taking their opinions seriously cause I had been a stan of Apple by then) some critics pointing to a nuanced concern.</description>

      <description>Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s new album drops on March 8th (Yep that&amp;rsquo;s International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day. Coincidence? I think not). The album&amp;rsquo;s titled &amp;ldquo;eternal sunshine&amp;rdquo;, a shoutout to the 2004 movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind directed by Michel Gondry and starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. This film, a favorite among critics, explores the complexities of memory and identity, themes that often echo in Grande&amp;rsquo;s work.
Grande&amp;rsquo;s well-known admiration for Carrey, whom she famously termed as her &amp;ldquo;first celebrity crush&amp;rdquo; on The Tonight Show, is more than a fangirl moment.</description>

      <description>The world of football once again witnessed a momentous occasion as Lionel Messi clinched The Best FIFA Men&amp;rsquo;s Player award, while Pep Guardiola was honored as the best coach. As a fervent admirer of both figures, this dual triumph resonates deeply with me, offering a blend of joy and professional intrigue. CONGRATULATIONS!
This recent accolade for Messi isn&amp;rsquo;t just a testament to his unparalleled skill on the field: the Ballon d&amp;rsquo;Or, a topic I&amp;rsquo;ve previously touched upon (see my earlier post), serves as a prime example of this intersection between sports and economics - just look into its voting mechanism and there would be highly interesting network patterns and bias and randomness.</description>

Thanks to their stan-like support, the Huawei Mate60 is often out of stock.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always a refreshing activity to start the morning with a MS paper - even better, a freshly published one right in Nov. 2023.
Dynamic Persuasion and Strategic Search Yunfei (Jesse) Yao, Management Science 22 Nov 2023
ABSTRACT
Consumers frequently search for information before making decisions. Because their search and purchase decisions depend on the information environment, firms have a strong incentive to influence it. This paper endogenizes the consumer’s information environment from the firm’s perspective and endogenizes the search decision from the consumer’s perspective.</description>

      <description>On December 22nd during DongZhi, there is the tradition of eating dumplings. Dumplings, once a symbol of warmth and comfort during the deep winter, now seem increasingly commercialized and expensive, particularly in chain stores and food delivery services. This shift reflects less of the cherished tradition and more of a capital-driven venture, stripping away the essence of what made these foods special.
An explanation I came across sheds light on this transformation:</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an immensely useful paper on the almost cliché yet rarely studied question how to read a paper, where it outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers.
Takeaways (of the three-pass approach):
The first pass (5-10 mins): quickly scan to get a bird&amp;rsquo;s-eye view of the whole paper.
Carefully read the title, abstract and introduction. Read the headings while ignore everything else. Read the conclusions. Scan the reference and tick-off the ones you&amp;rsquo;ve already read.</description>

At lunch, I found a gentleman and me stuck before the coffee machine, trying to find a paper cup so as to sneak some extra coffee from the canteen. Me, as a shameless young people free to act indecent, just stretched and grabbed some paper cups from the back of the coffee counter and shared it with the gentleman - we happily got coffee and was ready to leave.</description>

Me: So it was like, for management science, delivery of the talk really matters. For the TCS community it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter that much. At least well, to a lesser extent.
Vignesh: Yeah it&amp;rsquo;s true. But usually I&amp;rsquo;d like to view it from another perspective.</description>

      <description>In the bias and wisdom in decision making course that I&amp;rsquo;ve taken this semester, we featured the topic intertemperal choice today. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty cliché a topic that, well, usually everything starts with this function: $$ U(\mathbf x) = u(x_0) + \beta\sum_{t = 1}^\infty\sigma^t u(x_t). $$ But something interesting came up today. It&amp;rsquo;s called the growth curve. Consider choosing from various ways of growing over time - some trajectory is log-like while others can be exponential-like.</description>

      <description>Music is not just sound; it&amp;rsquo;s a tapestry woven from varied chords, voices, and instruments. In a pop melody like some Mariah Carey ballad, the lead vocal takes center stage, supported by complex add libs and rhythmic undercurrents. Not to mention classical pieces which are an intricate dance of harmonies, each note a thread in a larger musical fabric.
Yet, even the finest audio technology falls short in unraveling these layers completely, and as audience distinguishing every element remains a challenge.</description>

A pivotal 2021 study in SIGecom Exchanges by He et al. delved into this labyrinth on the behemoth platform, Amazon. The dance between third-party sellers, consumers, and the platform itself is somewhat like a strategic ballet, with each trying to outmaneuver the other for a sliver of extra margin. It&amp;rsquo;s an intricate competitive ecosystem where strategy meets survival.</description>

Certificates of the authenticity of luxury goods aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily real, especially on the secondary market. Counterfeiters are adept at creating fakes that are often sold at prices comparable to genuine products. And even, sometimes people knowingly buy fake items, like knock-off LV bags, just for the logo.</description>

      <description>In the labyrinth of academia, where jargon is the king and complexity its crown jewel, I&amp;rsquo;ve often found myself knee-deep in the weeds of technical details. So when I am in regular meetings with my advisor to talk about papers, it&amp;rsquo;s often the case that I got trapped into trying to explain all the maths. It&amp;rsquo;s a dance of numbers and theories, but the elegance of complexity often overshadows the audience - that my advisor often has to interrupt me and shift the topic back to the general background and insight of the researches.</description>

Our school had transformed the largest meeting room into a spectacle. A massive circular table dominated the center, surrounded by a hundred student volunteers, including myself.</description>

      <description>I knew, and was heavily influenced by a fascinating AER paper by Joel Waldfogel from 1993, aptly titled &amp;ldquo;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas.&amp;rdquo;
Economists often praise holiday spending for its positive macroeconomic effects. However, gift-giving’s critical microeconomic facet lies in the recipient making different choices than the giver. Essentially, gifts risk being mismatched with recipients&amp;rsquo; preferences, potentially causing a deadweight loss. Waldfogel’s paper, deriving data from Yale undergraduates&amp;rsquo; surveys, estimates holiday gift-giving destroys 10% to 33% of gifts&amp;rsquo; value.</description>

      <description>Regarding ADIP, a first-order method for solving LP, the following is an excerpt from Deng et al.&amp;rsquo;s arxiv page:
The ADMM-based interior point method (ABIP, Lin et al. 2021) is a hybrid algorithm which effectively combines the iterior point method and the first-order method to achieve performance boost in large-scale linear programming. Different from the standard interior point method which relies on a costly Newton step, ABIP applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to approximately solve the barrier penalized problem.</description>

      <description>Everyone is familiar with linear programming (LP) and its possibly NP-hard simplex algorithm. Additionally, there are interior-point methods and more. Recent advancements in the field are aimed at handling large-scale LP problems that necessitate parallel processing.
One approach is the PDHG (Primal Dual Hybrid Gradient) method, a first-order optimization method for large-scale LP. Another intriguing method is the second-order ADMM. While the PDHG method is straightforward in its core concept, it employs numerous heuristic techniques, some of which have solid theoretical foundations, to expedite the optimization process.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading up on keyword query ranking optimization literature recently. In this context, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Taobao, where multiple third-party sellers offer similar products when a user searches for a specific keyword. The platform&amp;rsquo;s goal is to maximize both the seller&amp;rsquo;s profit (a combination of surplus and revenue, calculated as price multiplied by quantity) and consumer satisfaction. So, the main questions here are:
How should products be ranked?</description>

      <description>The Freakonomics podcast delivered some inspiring insights today, focusing on a spectrum of failure assessment, from the most blameworthy to the most commendable. Failure, in this context, is defined as a preventable negative event. Amy Edmondson, a guest on the podcast, categorized the causes of failure into six distinct categories:
Sabotage Inattention Inability Task challenge Uncertainty Experimentation While these categories are distinct, most failure events likely result from a combination of several causes.</description>

      <description>Shanghai and LA share a common thread, their shared essence of being overwhelming kaleidoscopes of glamour. It&amp;rsquo;s as if both cities, like a scene from the classical spectacle of LA LA Land, break into song and dance, creating a harmonious yet complex symphony of life.

      <description>The platform economy is indeed a formidable force, and this assertion is not without merit.
Yesterday, after watching a routine Premier League match featuring Manchester City, I experienced a striking example of the platform economy&amp;rsquo;s impact. Around 00:05, when all public transportation had stopped running, I had no option but to order a Didi taxi, a service similar to Uber, to return to my dormitory. To my surprise, a driver quickly accepted my request, indicating that the demand was relatively low.</description>

      <description>EconCS lab opening As yesterday&amp;rsquo;s blog mentioned the opening premiere, here&amp;rsquo;s the fresh recap. The first section features ceremonial talks, and the second is a more lively discussion of mechanism design, economics, and artificial intelligence.
Section 1: Ceremonial Talks The first section of the event was filled with what we can affectionately describe as &amp;ldquo;ceremonial talks.&amp;rdquo; These talks are often marked by grand visions and mutual compliments, leaving the audience yearning for more substance.</description>

I initially planned to attend a coffee festival in the morning, but given that they&amp;rsquo;re offering complimentary coffee and snacks during the tea break, and with many of my friends, my advisor, and the entire ITCS community attending, it seems like a great idea.</description>

While browsing Professor Negin Golrezaei&amp;rsquo;s profile, I stumbled upon a series of captivating reports delving into the fierce competition that Amazon shops face.
Two of the most fascinating ones are from BuzzFeed News:

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been really obsessed with the song MONOPOLY by Ariana Grande and Victoria Monét
Treat like goals like property, collect them like monopoly.
It barely has nothing to do with &amp;ldquo;monopoly&amp;rdquo; but also has everything to do with monopoly. The song is just as playful as several other Ariana&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;insignificant&amp;rdquo; singles:
Work so fuckin&amp;rsquo; much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Yeah)
You&amp;rsquo;d be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)</description>

      <description>On with the discussion about the Guangdong/HK Tea Houses in Shanghai, with a focus on honest critique and analysis.
Firstly, the landscape is fiercely competitive. However, the competition does not translate into commensurate quality but rather inflated prices. This does not align with the typical characteristics of Bertrand competition. A cursory search on Meituan for &amp;ldquo;Tea Houses&amp;rdquo; within a 3-kilometer radius yields approximately 30 results, all claiming to offer authentic Guangdong or Hong Kong flavors.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently quite hooked on Mariah Carey these days.
For those not familiar with her, she&amp;rsquo;s the voice behind &amp;ldquo;All I Want for Christmas Is You.&amp;rdquo; Mariah skyrocketed to fame in the early &amp;rsquo;90s with her self-titled debut album, and her early career was defined by her extraordinary vocal prowess. Her runs, riffs, and live performances during that era set a standard that remains untouched, making it an almost impossible feat for young singers to surpass.</description>

      <description>I caught some intriguing facts during this morning&amp;rsquo;s breakfast broadcast, where they featured an episode with Claudia Goldin. One of the topics they covered was related to Goldin&amp;rsquo;s 2000 research paper, &amp;ldquo;Orchestrating Impartiality: The Impact of &amp;lsquo;Blind&amp;rsquo; Auditions on Female Musicians.&amp;rdquo;
Abstract A change in the audition procedures of symphony orchestras&amp;ndash;adoption of &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo; auditions with a &amp;ldquo;screen&amp;rdquo; to conceal the candidate&amp;rsquo;s identity from the jury&amp;ndash;provides a test for sex-biased hiring. Using data from actual auditions, in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases the probability a woman will be advanced and hired.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been trying to understand Ariana Grande, her music, lyrics, and interviews. Seeking a piece of her philosophy. Yet her artistic choices baffle with inconsistency, lacking a clear cohesive logic. She intentionally obscures, distorts motif, and leaves gaps.
I&amp;rsquo;ve immersed myself in her interviews and music, even the unreleased demos, piecing together her puzzle. Tonight, a new fragment from The Weeknd&amp;rsquo;s single &amp;ldquo;Escape from LA&amp;rdquo; from album After Hours adds to it.</description>

Regarding my personal preference, I favor the Black Swan significantly more than the White Swan. The Black Swan embodies life and vitality, with her charming smile lighting up the stage, captivating the audience (including the prince), and infusing the performance with energy.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to the carnival of economic theories! Episode 2: The Diamond Paradox. I love the paper.
Diamond&amp;rsquo;s model revolves around a discrete-time market, denoted as $t\in [T]$, featuring multiple consumers and firms.
Consumer Behavior Each consumer possesses a downward-sloping demand function $x(p)$, it decreases as price ($p$) increases. In this market, consumers have a strategic buying plan: they purchase a product in period $t$ if and only if the price is less than or equal to their predetermined cutoff price, $q$.</description>

      <description>During a family dinner today, we played a game, more like a question really. It went like this:
Imagine you (and everyone else on Earth) have to pick either a red or a blue button.
If more than half the people pick the blue button, everyone survives.
If not, only those who picked the red button survive.
I believe the people who brought up this game remembered it incorrectly. Clearly, the game was meant to present a tricky choice, but this version has an obvious dominant strategy - choosing the red button.</description>

      <description>The Werewolf game is a wildly popular social board game in China, enjoyed by groups of 4 to 10 players. It&amp;rsquo;s a versatile game that can be played in various settings, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a post-meal gathering or any other social occasion. The game has gained immense popularity, transcending friend circles. For instance, our orchestra crew delved into intense games of werewolf in the hotel lobby until the late hours during our tour, while the scientist squads (or actually, professors) engaged in a gripping round when they were unexpectedly confined indoors due to a rainstorm during a conference reception.</description>

      <description>Ariana Grande&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;goodnight n go&amp;rdquo; has an incredibly special place in my heart. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a song; it&amp;rsquo;s an emotional journey that I embark on every time I listen to it. At first, I was drawn to its dreamy and beautiful melody, and it quickly became my second favorite song. However, over time, it has come to mean so much more to me.
One of the most powerful parts of the song, for me, is the following part, as it reminds me of moments in my own life when I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to say goodbye to someone I cared about.</description>
