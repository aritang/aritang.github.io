Focus is an Ariana Grande single yet it doesn&rsquo;t belong to any of her studio albums:

The song was originally released as the lead single from Grande&rsquo;s third studio album, titled Moonlight at the time. As the album&rsquo;s concept changed and its title renamed to become Dangerous Woman, the song was removed from the main track list, including the standard and deluxe versions.
