It’s as if both cities, like a scene from the classical spectacle of LA LA Land, break into song and dance, creating a harmonious yet complex symphony of life.\nthe lyric of ‘A Lovely Night’ soundtrack of LA LA LAND. What a waste of lovely night… life’s too short, not a single nights should be wasted. as does tonight.\nLast night a moment of pure wonder unfolded as I hopped on a taxi, my heart racing against time. I uttered a request to the driver, urging him to whisk us to the concert hall as fast as possible. The car soared down the highway, slicing through the night of Shanghai, where its dark blue sky had been rent asunder by towering skyscrapers. What seemed like an eternity elapsed during that half-hour taxi ride, yet it felt as swift and ephemeral as a passing breeze.\nThe concert was graced by the virtuosity of Alexander Romanovky, who took us on a musical journey through the works of Chopin and Rachmaninoff. These two composers hold a special place in my heart, and listening to their compositions brought my soul to life. However, the most enchanting moment of the evening came as an encore, when the audience was treated to a live rendition of Debussy. It was nothing short of a magical experience, a reminder of the power of music to transcend time and place.\nAs I rushed from my dorm, a mere 25 minutes before the concert was set to begin, I harbored doubts about whether I would make it in time. But fate had other plans for me that evening, as I found myself swept up in a wave of enchantment and delight. The pianist encored 7 pieces tonight - an unprecedented beautiful miracle that I almost missed when I was hesitating in my dorm when my calendar lit up a notification stating an almost impossible event to catch. But it turned out to be the most delightful night of this entire semester, a shimmering jewel in the tapestry of my college life.\nAnd, to top it all off, I got his autograph! A little memento of a night that will forever reside in the corners of my heart.\nhe signed with a lipstick first (pretty expensive one btw). it was borrowed from a lovely lady lining after me. i first asked for a pen but she doesn’t have one. then she just handed me her lipstick. ‘catch the moment, young girl’, as she said.\n",
