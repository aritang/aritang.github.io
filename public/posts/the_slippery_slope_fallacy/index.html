At first glance it’s a clever analogy. It taps into fears of government overreach and boils down a complex issue into a soundbite.

And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.\nThe context matters. Buying insurance isn’t like buying broccoli. Healthcare insurance market involves more strategic players that plays different roles in much more complicated transfer structure. The analogy of healthcare insurance to broccoli is clever but fundamentally flawed because one is an agricultural product where its price is almost defined by supply and demand, the other—god knows?\nslippery slope, broadly speaking Definition A slippery slope fallacy is a logical fallacy: when someone claims that a small initial action (or event) will lead to a chain of events that result in a final huge negative outcome.
