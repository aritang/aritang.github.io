Overwhelmed by cues from ads, editor's picks, and various nudges, I finally caved and downloaded the new [Apple Music Classical](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/03/apple-music-classical-is-here/) app. Though it was released on March 28, 2023, its recent intensive marketing push has really put it in the spotlight. Reflecting on my use of the app, it's clear that it has significantly improved the classical music listening experience, making it more professional, smooth, and enjoyable.

## huh? another music app?

Apple Classical comes at zero extra expense if one already has Apple Music subscribtion, seamlessly integrating every piece from the classical genre in one's Apple Music library. So people are asking like, why is there a separate app for classical music?

> Classical music is different. It has longer and more detailed titles, multiple artists for each work, and hundreds of recordings of well-known pieces. The Apple Music Classical app is designed to **support the complex data structure** of classical music.

## recommendation: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

In the [official news release](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/03/apple-music-classical-is-here/), Apple offers an extensive showcase of Apple Classical's impressive features. Boasting the **world's largest classical music catalog** and a design meticulously tailored for the genre, the app exemplifies Apple's signature minimalist elegance. Yet, I'd still like to spotlight two particular sweets:

### album cover and portraits🥳

Apple has refreshed artworks for both mainstream and **female**🥰/minority💖 composers, intriguingly noting that most were designed on Mac and iPad – a subtle nod to their ecosystem:

> Apple Music Classical listeners will also enjoy exclusive brand-new artwork, including hundreds of playlist covers, as well as unique, high-resolution digital portraits for many of the world’s greatest composers. Commissioned from a diverse group of artists, each image blends historical research with color palettes and artistic references from the relevant classical period. With the majority of these new works designed on Mac and iPad... (blahblahblah, hear hear)

For example:

{{<figure align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aritang/aritangPictures/main/static/tattooed_heart/shostakovich.jpeg" caption="[**Dmitri Shostakovich**]: Spotify composer profile (left) and Apple Music Classical composer art (right). i think everybody **EXCEPT** for Dmitri himself would, prefer, Apple's version.">}}

For contemporary composers like Astor Piazzolla or John Cage (yep the 4'33'' dude), they've chosen abstract paintings, adding a playful yet fitting visual dimension to their innovative music.

### classical insights

It's evident that the editors have put considerable effort into crafting insightful and engaging commentary for playlists and individual pieces. For instance, their introduction to Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 1 in G Major is a prime example of this thoughtful approach:

> Mozart was in Mannheim on a concert tour in 1778 when he met Ferdinand Dejean, a "gentleman of means" and a keen amateur flutist. A request for three concertos resulte, but Mozart ultimately delivered only two. **The Flute Concerto No. 1 goes well beyond Dejean's request for a "small, easy, and short" composition, which may be part of the reason he paid Mozart only half the sum agreed for the overall commission.** 👀**👀**👀
>
> The Concerto opens brightly, with a bracing string introduction and warm punctuation from a pair of horns. **The solo flute bubbles with vitality, spinning roulades requiring considerable technical agility.** The slow movement is effortlessly airborne and elegant, while hinting gently at emotional complexities just below the surface. A playful sense of humor permeates the finale, the solo flute delivering a string of high-velocity runs and decorations as the music moves to an unmistakably cheerful conclusion.

"Bubbles with vitality", "hinting gently at emotional complexities just below the surface" - like, OMG, right? I assure with my musical professionality that this is NOT any random bullshits to baffle readers.

### bonus: no shuffle🚫🔀, and a popularity rank🍉💅🏻

The Browse-Catalogue feature in the menu, particularly in sub-categories like "composers" or "conductors," offers an intriguing functionality where users can **rank** the lists by various criteria, including **popularity**.

{{<figure align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aritang/aritangPictures/main/static/tattooed_heart/rank.jpeg" caption="i was like hooooold on, why on earth is Bach ranked above Mozart?🤪🍉">}}

Wrapping up with a truly standout feature that enhances the classical experience in a unique way, that, according to Apple Support:

> Shuffle isn't available in the Apple Music Classical app.

Fireeeee🔥
