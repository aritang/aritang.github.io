It's my birthday today, and it happens to be Chicago's first snow of 2025 winter. Couldn't it be happier! And let me share the happiness vicariously with all of you reading.

It's been a lot for the past year for me. Here's a lovely, interesting song to go with the day — *Thank Goodness* performed live by Ariana Grande — "***getting your dream seems a little strange, well, complicated.***" But after all

> We couldn't be happier. Because happy is what happens when all your dream come true.

Notice the happy trumpet players who watched this whole song (while possibly counting a looooot of bars) from the best seat.
