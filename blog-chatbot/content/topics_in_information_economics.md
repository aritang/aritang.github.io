A collection of class notes from 25 Fall's Topics in Information Economics, taught by Professor Kamenica at Chicago Booth.

- [Blackwell's Theorem](/posts/blackwells_theorem/)
- [Aumann's Common Knowledge Theorem](/posts/agreeing_to_disagree/)
- [A Unified Modeling Perspective to Compare Cheap Talk and Information Design](/posts/cheap_talk_n_info_design/)
- [LP Characterization of Cheap Talk vs. Bayesian Persuasion Game](/posts/dual_formulation_of_cheap_talk_vs_bp/)
- [The last three lectures](/posts/info_design_last_class/)

We did more than this but I don't own the full lecture note's copy right. If you find it useful or interesting, the credits goes to Prof Kemenica. If confusing, that's probably my fault. Enjoy :)
