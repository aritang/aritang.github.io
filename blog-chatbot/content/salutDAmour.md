As the title suggests, this short and sweet piece is a love song:

> Elgar finished the piece in July 1888, when he was romantically involved with Caroline Alice Roberts, and he called it *"Liebesgruss"* ('Love's Greeting') because of Miss Roberts' fluency in German. On their engagement she had already presented him with a poem "*The Wind at Dawn*" which he set to music and, when he returned home to London on 22 September from a holiday at the house of his friend Dr. Charles Buck in Settle, he gave her *Salut d'Amour* as **an engagement present**. (Wikipedia)

Jesus.

My friend listened to hundreds of recordings and insisted that Daniel Hope did Sir Edward Elgar's *Salut d'amour*'s best recording. "On April 22, 2016 violin legend Yehudi Menuhin would have celebrated his 100th birthday. Daniel Hope dedicates a complete album to his former mentor and close friend - "My Tribute to Yehudi Menuhin". Watch Daniel Hope play "Salut d´amour" of Edward Elgar."

Guess love isn't all valentines-day exclusive.
