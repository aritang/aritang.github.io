The theoretically optimal way to board passengers onto a plane has been studied by Jason Steffen in his paper *Optimal boarding method for airline passengers*. The following YouTube video explains the algorithm and also, briefly touches on why it's not actually implemented. The math is super elegant, the problem is practical, and gives a bit of an economic design insight (that you don't always get the theoretical perfect design)
