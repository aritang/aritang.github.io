While most of the time we flutists are happy stealing pieces from violins, for Paganini's Caprice No 5, I'm happy to just left it to the violinists.

I like Itzhak Perlman's version because he tends to **speed up** at hard parts, which makes him sound even more impressive and very satisfying to listen to. You feel the momentum and the piece is actually moving forward instead of stuck by a technical bottleneck:

And plus there's a famous meme "I know I played every note!". (Perlman was explaining acoustic/echoing in concert halls. When the venue is very echoey, fast notes can sound blurred together in a mess)
