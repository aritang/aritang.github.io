*The Grand Budapest Hotel* (2014) written and directed by Wes Anderson was inspired by Zweig's *Die Welt von Gestern*. It's the pinnacle of color grading and metaphors. The film got 9 academy award nominations and won 4. The movie's intrinsic core is quite obvious.

> Even from the abyss of horror in which we try to feel our way today, half-blind, our hearts distraught and shattered, I look up again and again to the ancient constellations that shone on my childhood, comforting myself with the inherited confidence that, some day, this relapse will appear only an interval in the eternal rhythm of progress onward and upward.

> Wes Anderson's lighthearted Eastern European epic found its perfect match in composer Alexandre Desplat, whose score borrows from **Russian folk music, European classical, and vintage Hollywood soundtracks**. Opening with an unaccompanied male chorus in "S'Rothe-Zäuerli," the music includes the regional sounds of balalaikas, zithers, and Alpine horns. Orchestral pieces like "M. Ivan" and "Cleared of All Charges" hark back to Maurice Jarre's classic *Doctor Zhivago* score. And Desplat's arrangement of the traditional tune "Moonshine," plucked at dizzying speed, underlines the film's whimsical side.
