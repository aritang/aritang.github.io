Prokofiev composed the *Flute Sonata* (Op. 94) between 1942-43. Though it is commissioned, he like flute (thankfully) and probably had poured his personality all over the piece — "I had long wished to write music for the flute, an instrument which I felt had been undeservedly neglected." In 1943 Prokofiev adapted few changes for bowing to transcribe a version for violin. Ah, the long tradition of flutist and violinist stealing each other's repertoire.

It's a splendidly difficult piece. The National Flute Association's graded repertoire guide put this piece at **Level K**, the highest level of difficulty on the grading scale. Watch the last 2 minutes of the piece, performed by Pahud and La Sage on the opening of MantovaMusica 2019 — you'll get how exciting (and exhausting) it is:

Interestingly, though there are a number of recordings easily accessible online, it takes a bit of effort to find good live performance recordings. But for this piece particular, live performance sounds better.

There are four movements. The best 1st movement version, in my pov, is by a live version of **Boris Bizjak**:

For the 2nd movement, **Sir James Galway with Martha Argerich** has a splendid recording:

I'm too young to judge the slow movement. Nevertheless, for the Adagio movement (mvt III) I found our violin friend's version (and masterclass) quite inspiring:

The dashing 4th movement, a dashing, brilliant live version by Galway:
