Tchaikovsky's 18 Morceaux (Op. 72) were his last works for solo piano, completed April 1893  (Tchai passed away Nov 6 1893, his last work is the Symphony Pathetique, which is Op. 74). He thought himself that this was kinda doing "homework" composing these pieces:

> I've been performing my duties very punctiliously, and each day a musical offspring is born. However, these offspring are very much immature and insubstantial; I have no inclination whatsoever to create them, and do so only for the money. I'm only trying to ensure that they don't turn out too badly.
>
> Letter 4913 to Vladimir Davydov, 11/23 April 1893.

Tchaikovsky dedicated every of the 18 pieces to different people. What did he left for himself? And all he thought about his production was just '*not too badly*'? (Well, Tchaik is indeed somewhat famous for his self-doubt...)

Judge yourself — here's *Chant élégiaque* (No. 14) by Pletnev, ***live***. It's my favourite among the 18 pieces.
