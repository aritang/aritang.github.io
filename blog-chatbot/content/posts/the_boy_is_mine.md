Ariana Grande's albums invariably feature at least one so-called 'bad-girl anthem'. Take her debut album 'Yours Truly', arguably the most innocent of her career, which includes the sultry track ***The Way***. This song is a collaboration with her then-boyfriend Mac Miller, and it famously includes the line, "I got a bad boy, you must admit it." Her subsequent albums—***My Everything*** and ***Dangerous Woman***—further shaped her image as a love-craving icon. Even ***Sweetener*** offers *R.E.M.*, which lyrically flirts with:

> Boy, you're such a dream to me...
>
> "Excuse me, ummmm... I love u. I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble."

A recent unreleased song, *fantasize*, originally penned for a Korean pop group and never officially released, has since become a top TikTok background music hit. Grande reflects on the song’s reception:

> I love [the original] song. I've always wanted to reimagine it in some way. [I got the idea] when I saw my fans' reaction to "Fantasize" because they love it so much... I kind of was like 'this is a very bad idea, I think', but there is a large group of my fans that really do love a bad girl anthem, and this is kind of an elevated version of that.

Her latest album ***eternal sunshine*** includes the track *the boy is mine*.

The music video, released yesterday, follows a similar theme to *yes, and*. It enriches whatever Ariana Grande is trying to convey and enhances the song. I'll delve deeper into its analysis tomorrow.
