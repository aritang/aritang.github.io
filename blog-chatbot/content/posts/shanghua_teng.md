[Professor Shang-Hua Teng](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~shanghua/) from USC is visiting our institute (ITCS@SUFE) today. A distinguished mathematician and theoretical computer scientist, Professor Teng shared valuable career insights during an open panel discussion. Later, he delivered a talk on his recent work, [*Regularization and Optimal Multiclass Learning*](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v247/asilis24a.html), co-authored with Julian Asilis, Siddartha Devic, Shaddin Dughmi, and Vatsal Sharan, and presented at the Thirty-Seventh Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) 2024.

The talk was very clear and well-organized and exceptionally clear for theory—Teng is of course a great theorist but also I think he is an excellent presenter! I have marked it for further study.
