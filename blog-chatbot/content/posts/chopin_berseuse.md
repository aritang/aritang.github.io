You *can* but don't necessarily have to use fancy harmonic to write a masterpiece (Like math for research). Chopin proves this point — you need only two chords to write a masterpiece. Here's his wonderful Berceuse (Op. 57). It's a very sophisticated, rich work full of room for imagination.

*Note*: I really likes the following Sumino's recording where, it sounds like either he's using the sostenuto pedal or it's a really soft piano.
