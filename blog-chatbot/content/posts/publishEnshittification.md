Academic industry is a beautiful ecosystem that has contributed a lot to human. It's more easy to criticize something that is supposed to be perfect and pure.

This is an article based on paper *[The junkification of research](https://doi.org/10.1177/13505084251399576)* by Martina Linnenluecke and Carl Rhodes:

> ## The 5 stages of the ‘enshittification’ of academic publishing

> Martina Linnenluecke, Carl Rhodes | [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us) | January 5, 2026

> The social media platforms, e-commerce sites and search engines they were using had noticeably deteriorated in quality. Many had begun to prioritise content from advertisers and other third parties. Profit became the main goal... ***Enshittification*** isn’t just confined to the online world. In fact, it’s now visible in academic publishing and occurs in five stages. The same forces that hollow out digital platforms are shaping how a lot of research is produced, reviewed and published.

> ## Academic enshittification
>
> Based on these trends, we identified a five-stage downward spiral in the enshittification of academic publishing.
>
> 1. The commodification of research shifts value from intellectual merit to marketability
> 2. The proliferation of pay-to-publish journals spreads across and expands both elite and predatory outlets
> 3. A decline in quality and integrity follows as profit-driven models compromise peer review and oversight
> 4. The sheer volume of publications makes it difficult to identify authoritative work. Fraudulent journals spread hoax papers and pirated content
> 5. Enshittification follows. The scholarly system is overwhelmed by quantity, distorted by profit motives, and is stripped of its purpose of advancing knowledge.

I don't think 1 implies 2 implies 3 implies 4 then implies enshittification. It feels more like the industry's publish-or-perish culture naturally leads to the bad equilibrium. And the above 5 points are just properties of this equilibrium.

Academia is a market filled with clever, strategic, incentivized agents. The benign, upright motive of "human's purist pursuit of knowledge" is just so fragile compared to the incentives and lure that people face to cheat and game the system in all ways that doesn't stand up to the highest quality that one anticipates for it. It's a miracle that academia flourished til today with its contributions. But with proper design, guidance, and regulation of the system, it can probably do better than it is doing right now.
