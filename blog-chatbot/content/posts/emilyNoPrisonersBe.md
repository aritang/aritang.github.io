*Emily – No Prisoner Be* is a song cycle composed by Kevin Puts based on poems by Emily Dickinson. CSO's 25/26 season resident artist Joyce DiDonato, who is also the OG artist thet premiered this work, performed the work Feb 12 on Chicago Symphony Center.

Joyce DiDonato's technique is ***impeccable***. Her control over her voice is so powerful that she is just free to do whatever she wants. I find Emily Dickinson's poetry lacks clarity and kinda incomprehensible, but it was Joyce singing so it doesn't really matter.

Virtuosity at the service of intelligence. I am impressed.
