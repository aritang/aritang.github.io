The night started with Kodály's *Dances of Galánta*, then Hadelich joined for Dvořák *Violin Concerto*, lastly Brahms's *Symphony No. 2*. The digital program book which contains full, detailed, amazingly written notes can be found [here](https://issuu.com/chicagosymphony/docs/program_book_-_cso_at_wheaton_hadelich_dvo_k_). My friend says that someone said that unpaid intern hold those pens.

I'm not violin nor Brahms expert. But it was definitely a splendid night that even the 48-minute super long Brahms symphony failed to bore me. 

And, Hadelich encored *Por Una Cabeza* (nooooooooo)
