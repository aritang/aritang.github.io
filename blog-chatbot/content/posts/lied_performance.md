A two-day series on Lieder

Today I had the privilege of attending a concert curated and performed by Changyong Liao, alongside his long-time collaborator, German pianist Hartmut Höll. The duo masterfully arranged a series of Lieder (aka, art songs) titled *Three Wishes of the Rose: 16 Chinese Lieders*. Witnessing these original composers interpret these songs was a profound experience, filled with a rich tapestry of emotions and beauty.

Btw, about the two artists:

## Hartmut Höll

> **Hartmut Höll**'s playing is characterized by a sense of sound, sensitivity, and the ability to think "behind" the notes, to create atmosphere, and to let the listener experience sensations directly in the timbres. For decades he has been one of the most sought-after piano partners. He knows the value of chamber music collaboration and is wise enough to cultivate long-term partnerships.
>
> Together with the president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Hartmut Höll edited Chinese art songs created by Chinese composers since 1920 under European influence but with Chinese idiom and setting poems from a thousand-year tradition. This edition is published by Breitkopf & Härtel.
