Today, the University of Chicago Symphony Orchestra plays our December Concert. We did Tchaikovsky 5th Symphony, and premiered Daniel Pesca's Piano Concerto *Up North*.

I played the Piccolo. For contemporary piece like Up North, there's no melody so you can only count beats. It's a very very stressful position to be in — because for a piccolo, there's hardly cues from other instruments and I'm on my own. And after all, piccolo is a difficult instrument. It's easy to make mistakes, and **everyone** hears it.

For example, the 3rd mvt of *Up North* begins with the piano dropping crystal, fast notes. The orchestra remains silence, and after a clueless rest of ***a 4/4 bar, a 3/4 bar, a 4/4 bar, three 3/4 bars, a 2/4 bar and a 4/4 bar*** — then the piccolo enters (precisely on the next downbeat) playing a high-E (4 octaves above center) on its own.

Check it out below — I timed the video to start at the beginning of the 3rd movement of Up North. Try to count, you'll feel me:
