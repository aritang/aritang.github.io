Nature has a lovely, **open-source** annual graduate survey:

> *Springer Nature* conducted a global survey of PhD candidates in science in 2025, in partnership with Thinks Insights & Strategy, a research consultancy based in London. The survey ran in June and July 2025 and received 3,785 self-selecting respondents from 107 countries. The findings about PhD graduate student experiences are covered in an article series from Nature’s Careers team.

Link to the survey data: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Nature_s_Graduate_Survey_2025/30084739/1 The data is rich, and in my pov, very dense in information. Nature already published several articles about it:

- *How money, politics and technology are redefining the PhD experience in 2025* *https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03149-7*
- *What makes PhD students happy? Good supervision* *https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03416-7*
- *27 things we wish we’d known when we started our PhDs* *https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03229-8*
- *Are these the happiest PhD students in the world?* *https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03346-4*
