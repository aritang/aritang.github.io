FYI, the OG ballet of *Rite of Spring* depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring (in Russia), after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. 

Klaus carried Rite of Spring to its extreme. His version embodies a raw, primitive connection with the nature, and the ultimate unrestness of human heart. Energy, passion, MADNESS!

Interesting fact: *The Rite of Spring* calls for a large woodwind section. The flute section typically features three main flute parts, plus a piccolo and an alto flute, with the third flute often doubling piccolo, totaling around **5 players** to cover these roles.
