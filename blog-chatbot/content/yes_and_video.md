It'd be cool to use the opening lyrics of Ariana Grande's 7th album lead single **yes, and** to be a title. And, <u>*in case you haven't noticed*</u>, the [music video](https://youtu.be/eB6txyhHFG4?si=kULJZJ-IuNOd094o) is out today and it's next level. You'll just love it.

And there's a really cool [rap cover version]( https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nT4y1n7Eh/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=7d9988cd6152d87ab6877f7dea245a0b). Well, similar people attracts and us Arianators are as gifted and brilliant as usual.
