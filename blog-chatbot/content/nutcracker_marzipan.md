Technically, the 2nd act of Nutcracker takes place in the candy kingdom. Marzipan is a kind of dessert. However, the original French name for the dance, *Mirlitons*, is an older term for a simple reed or pipe flute, similar to a kazoo. Huh. Puns.

> As I said, timeless. The high-pitched trill of the orchestral flutes float up to the stage and seemingly fuel our steps, which are as colorful, bright & perky as our costumes. [Tutus & Tea](https://tutusandtea.wordpress.com/2011/12/10/marzipan-memories/)

> I always found the Marzipan music,(Dance of the Reed Flutes) in THE NUTCRACKER to be the most treacly and too sweet by far. It could give one diabetes. [John Cliff Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzzLJ4vInkR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==)

Balanchine has a really interesting choreography for this: though the double flutes are written in perfect sync, the dancer are not and the corps is always a step behind the lead. Watch below the brilliant Tyler Peck, making the hard-as-s**t choreography looks like just a piece of marzipan:
