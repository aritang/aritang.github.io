The duopoly of Christmas music is probably Mariah Carey or Tchaikovsky. In Chicago's airport bathroom, plays a pop-mashed Super Plum Fairy variation in the airport bathroom. The violin carries the melody and the background adds **drums** (jesus, that is aweful). Remember, the OG composition is supposed to use a **celesta**, which Tchaikovsky pioneered its use in Orchestra and soon becomes viral:

> The celesta [was] invented by the Parisian organ-maker Auguste Mustel in 1886. It is smaller than the piano, almost a toy by comparison, and with a less expansive keyboard... Picture a [glockenspiel](https://www.vsl.co.at/academy/percussion/glockenspiel), a mainstay of orchestral percussion sections, hidden inside a piano.

> Tchaikovsky heard the celesta in Paris while on his way to the United States ... and described the experience in an 1891 letter to his publisher:
>
> > I discovered a new orchestral instrument in Paris, something between a miniature piano and a Glockenspiel, with a divinely wondrous sound. … The instrument is called the “Celesta Mustel” and costs 1,200 francs. It can be obtained only from its Paris inventor, M. Mustel. I’m hoping you’ll order this instrument for me.

> In Nutcracker, Tchaikovsky unleashed the instrument’s full potential. In “The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy,” he at first treats it almost as a piano, with . No longer background color, the celesta becomes, for the first time, the center of attention.

And then Celesta's orchestra career takes off: Mahler, Richard Strauss, Gershwin.

> In the 21st century, the celesta may be most closely associated with a work of fantasy that rivals “The Nutcracker” in popularity: the Harry Potter films.

> The film adaptation of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” opens with the defining musical motif of the series, a You could describe this tune with the same language you would use for “The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy”: toylike in its fun and transporting in its allure. Above all, it is magical.

> Instruments have a way of quickly conjuring moods and images, and that’s largely because of how they’ve been used in the past. The English horn is nostalgic; the French horn, noble. And if “Hedwig’s Theme” immediately brings the world of magic to mind, that association was planted by Tchaikovsky well over a century ago in “The Nutcracker.”

MERRY CHRSITMAS, and may magic and love be with you for 2026 :)
