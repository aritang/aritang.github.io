This is a loosely sorted and lightly annotated catalogue of through the music posts on this blog — meant to be browsed the way you'd flip through a record collection at a friend's apartment. I write about classical music when life gets hectic, so if you notice a cluster of posts, that's my life running on prestissississimo...

## I. The Romantics and Their Restless Hearts

The Romantic composers feel like me — dramatic, inconsolable, and occasionally insufferable in the best way. Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff take up the most space here, probably because their music never quite lets me go. Chopin appears when I need elegance; Brahms and Schumann, when I want something tangled and human.

**Tchaikovsky — always Tchaikovsky:**

- [Chopin's 215th Birthday | A Little Fact about the Composer](/posts/chopin_2025/)

- [Lullabies | Chopin Berceuse Op. 57](/posts/chopin_berseuse/)

**Brahms, Schumann & Schubert — the inner circle:**

- [The Brahms–Schumann triangle](/posts/brahmns_n_clara/) (tea)
- Schumann's Kinderszenen: [Children's Day Music](/posts/childerns_day/) and [Horowitz playing Träumerei, Moscow 1986](/posts/horowitz_traumerei/)

## III. Stage Creatures — Ballet & Opera

Ballet music is not light music. I've argued this at length. When a piece is written for the stage — for bodies, for breath, for an arc that spans three acts — it carries a kind of weight that concert music sometimes only gestures at. These posts live at the intersection of music, choreography, and storytelling.

**Swan Lake — the obsession:**

- [On the Alleged Lightness of Swan Lake as 'Ballet Music'](/posts/ballet_music_slaps/) — a polemic
- [Tchaikovsky's Swan Coda from the Appendix](/posts/black_swan_coda/)
- [Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux Female Variation Sheet Music](/posts/swan_lake_appendix_variationii_sheet/)
- ['Why a swan? Why not turn her into a penguin'](/posts/why_not_turn_her_into_a_penguin/)

**The Nutcracker — a divertissement series:**

- [Nutcracker by Christopher Wheeldon and the Joffrey Ballet](/posts/nutcracker_by_wheeldon/)
- [Chocolate (Spanish Dance)](/posts/nutcracker_chocolate/), [Arabian Coffee](/posts/nutcracker_arabian_coffee/), [Chinese Tea](/posts/nutcracker_tea/), [Russian Dance 'Trepak'](/posts/nutcracker_russian_dance/), [Marzipan / Dance of the Reed Flutes](/posts/nutcracker_marzipan/), [Mother Gigogne](/posts/nutcracker_mother_gigogne/), [The Waltz of the Flowers](/posts/nutcracker_waltz_flowers/)

**More ballet:**

- [A Night with Joffrey's Carmen](/posts/carmen_by_joffery_ballet/)
- [I Married Myself, by Christopher Wheeldon](/posts/i_married_myself/)

**Opera:**

- [Breakdown of Eugene Onegin's Different Versions](/posts/onegin/)
- [Lensky's Aria from Eugene Onegin](/posts/lenskys_aria/)

Everything else — and honestly, some of the best stuff. Pieces I stumbled across and couldn't stop thinking about. Performers who changed how I hear things.

This list will keep growing — probably fastest during deadline season. If you'd like the flat, no-frills version, the original [catalogue](/posts/updated_classical_music_series/) is still there, and updated.
