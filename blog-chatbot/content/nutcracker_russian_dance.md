Tchaikovsky's music is so iconic that the dance 'Trepak' is always associated with the piece. Cause technically, Trepak is a fast, energetic folk dance that originated in Ukraine and Southern Russia, known for its male dancers performing athletic moves like **leg-flinging**. It is widely recognized as the "Russian Dance" from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker. The name comes from the Ukrainian word for the dance, tropak.

Good old memory from [Tugan Sokhiev with Munich Philharmonic in Shanghai 2024](/posts/follow_up_tchaikovsky_polonaise/): the momentum, the rhythm, the chill of sitting at the choral seat for an encore of full spirit!
