**Plants vs. Zombies** (2009), crafted by PopCap, is more than just a game. Sure, I could wax technical about how it’s essentially a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a tightly defined set of actions and stochastic outcomes. But really, it’s about strategic greenery and quirky zombies invading your lawn in an oddly delightful dance of sunlight and survival.

The background music of **Plants vs. Zombies** offers a whimsical electronic symphony that's pure auditory joy. Composed by Laura Shigihara, the soundtrack is available across various streaming platforms, delivering a series of tracks that transcend the typical video game score. These compositions blend cuteness with a touch of eerie, mirroring the game’s blend of cheerful plants and looming zombie threats.

The album's final track, *Zombies on Your Lawn*, occupies a special place in my heart. Picture this: it’s June during my high school years. Exams are over, and my class is coasting through the last week before summer break, commandeering the classroom’s digital whiteboard to play through the game.

Our classroom became a playground, with even our usually vigilant class supervisor turning a blind eye to our digital escapades. When we finally conquered the final boss and the credits rolled, the room erupted in applause—a celebration not just of our victory over the game, but of the endless summer days that lay ahead. It was a time when the future was a distant thought, and the present was all about the joy of the moment.

Oh, and it was the summer of 2019. As we rallied around that screen, none of us knew what the future held, but just the camaraderie binding us as we faced down hordes of animated undead.
