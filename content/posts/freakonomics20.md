Stephen Dubner is in town today for the 20th anniversary of *Freakonomics*, at an open conversation event hosted by Chicago Humanities. It’s even better than a live podcast.

Stephen called the *podcast* industry in general as one of Steve Jobs’ greatest inventions. By introducing a simple but open content-upload API, that once “stupid purple app” slashed the cost of journalism to nearly zero — making great ideas freely available to anyone, anywhere.

But I think Stephen is a little too humble here. The openness of the medium and tech innovation matters, yes — but so do the creators who use it well. The responsible, curious, and generous people who keep sharing what they know are just as much a part of the story. Thanks for the amazing 20 years!
