I have taken courses in mathematical statistics, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and several optimization courses. Additionally, I am registered for an econometrics course next semesterðŸ˜±. So, like currently, it's a stage where I have laid a strong theoretical foundation and possess a mastery of Python and R in data analysis, but my hands-on experience in tackling real-world problems is almost non-existent. After all, the datasets we used in class assignments are primarily toy examples that are cleaned, checked, and designed for specific tasks.

Nevertheless, it would be interesting to reflect on what I have learned so far. Therefore, in the upcoming days within this week, I promise to feature a series titled "**What I Have Learned in My Toolkit for Data Analysis**". Stay tuned!
