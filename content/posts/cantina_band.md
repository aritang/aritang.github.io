Predicting the next viral song on TikTok is almost as hard, if not even more, compared to interest rates fluctuations. Question: can we treat TikTok viral music as a pure random selection?

Regardless of the music-pop mechanism, **John Williams** would have a seat reserved for him at the TikTok Hall of Fame. One of his composition for starwars is now the constant popular song on TikTok — does the following music ring any bells?
