Here's a gift to all for 2025's beginning. It's going to be a fun year.

> Will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time.
>
> What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where to start from.
>
> â€” T.S. Eliot, [Little Gidding](https://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/winter/w3206/edit/tseliotlittlegidding.html).
