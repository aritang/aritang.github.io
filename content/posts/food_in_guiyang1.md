Guiyang’s food mirrors the city’s geography and spirit — rugged, unpretentious, and joyfully rebellious. As I wrote before ([Why the food here is so spicy…]()), history gave China Southwest people a deep bond with chili. Add to that the fact that Guiyang has never been a major economic, political, or trade hub, and you get a food culture that defies easy categorization — a kind of *culinary anarchy*.

In Guangzhou — arguably the city with the best food in China — cooking is treated like a form of high art. A single shrimp dumpling there has to follow an exact choreography: the skin must be translucent but elastic, the filling is expected to be '鲜' and the shrimp inside sweet and bouncy. Like there’s a “right” way to do almost everything.

In Guiyang? Not so much. Here the only rule is: if it tastes good, it’s fair game. In Guangzhou fish needs to be fresh out of water and steamed, flavored with special-made soysauce — so that you taste its OG flavor. But here they are piled high in deep bowls, swimming in a scarlet broth heavy with chili flakes, pickled vegetables, and fried soybeans that give a crackling bite.

The dishes are often oil-heavy, carb-rich, and fiercely flavored, but they carry a kind of **improvisational charm**. You can taste the cook’s mood, the day’s market finds, and sometimes a little chaos — a handful of fresh herbs here, a splash of vinegar there. And nowhere is that spirit clearer than in three dishes that gleefully defy the so-called golden rules of eating:

- **糯米饭 (Glutinous Rice)** – Bowls of steaming sticky rice topped with cured meats, crushed peanuts, and chili powder.

- **辣子鸡 (Chili Chicken)** ([wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laziji)): small chunks of fried chicken buried under mountains of dried chili and Sichuan peppercorns.

- **酸汤鱼 (Sour Soup Fish)** – Perhaps the most shocking to Cantonese sensibilities: fresh river fish simmered in a tomato-fermented sour broth.

I used to think this meant the food wasn’t “good class.” But I’ve grown to understand and occasionally appreciate the mindset: food as a conversation between appetite and instinct, and also, what our budget allows.
