The music industry is booming in 2024. What a scene. Following Ariana Grande's *eternal sunshine* release in March, Taylor Swift's tenth album in April, Dua Lipa in May. And now Sabrina Carpenter has taken over to begin her campaign for her new project *Short n' Sweet*.

Sabrina Carpenter’s latest single looks to take her breakout year to an even-higher level. Her season is in full effect. As “Espresso” continues to dominate, “Please Please Please,” the second single from Carpenter’s forthcoming *Short n’ Sweet* LP, has emerged as yet another smash for the pint-sized pop star.

The song also got an additional boost from its live debut on Saturday, during Carpenter’s buzzy set at New York’s Gov Ball festival––Sabrina Carpenter maintained her momentum by appearing in intence music festival performances. As in the other hit *Expresso* she sings "I'm working late, cause I'm a singer"––indeed is she practising what she preaches in *Expresso*. Like “Espresso,” “Please” has also earned a viral moment thanks to its cute songwriting, with the “Heartbreak is one thing, my ego’s another/ I beg you, don’t embarrass me, motherf–ker” lyric garnering ample traction across socials.
