Jony Ive has really good taste. Now, will OpenAI also have good taste?

(Basicallly, Jony Ive was in charge of Apple's design—iPhone4S, Apple Watch, iPad, Macbook—the crazily trendy minimalistic silver look. He created and led this omnipresent minimalist fashion that influenced and infiltrated into EVERYTHING.) 

And now Jony Ive teams up with OpenAI. The news is all over the internet. Interestingly it somewhat looks like a planned marketing campaign. When I searched "Jony Ive San Altman" on Google, an **ads** pop up:

Anyway. It seems OpenAI is building some **hardware**, and they want Jony Ive to be in charge of the design—is OpenAI trying to walk Apple's old path?

> This is an extraordinary moment.
>
> Computers are now seeing, thinking and understanding.
>
> Two years ago, Jony Ive and the creative collective LoveFrom, quietly began collaborating with Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI.
>
> ...
>
> It became clear that our ambitions to develop, engineer and manufacture a new family of products demanded an entirely new company. And so, one year ago, Jony founded io with Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey and Tang Tan.
>
> We gathered together the best hardware and software engineers, the best technologists, physicists, scientists, researchers and experts in product development and manufacturing. Many of us have worked closely for decades.
>
> **The io team, focused on developing products that inspire, empower and enable, will now merge with OpenAI to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco.**
>
> As io merges with OpenAI, Jony and LoveFrom will assume deep design and creative responsibilities across OpenAI and io.
>
> We could not possibly be more excited.

> Sam & Jony
