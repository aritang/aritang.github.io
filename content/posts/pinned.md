Hi, my name is Ariana Tang, and this is my blog where I write things about my research, my artistic viewpoints and occasionally my life.

### academic

As a junior undergrad student majoring CS in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, my academic pursuits are rooted in the interdisciplinary of market design and algorithmic game theory, to leverage the power and elegance of mathematics to economic theory.

Moreover, I believe that game theorists also need to be sensitive to cultural and psychological factors to understand the incentives and constraints that people face. Acute perception, mathematical skills and a deep sense of empathy embodies the essence of a modern economist, and is what I'm committed to becoming.

Currently I'm working on auctions with [**Prof. Pinyan Lu**](http://pinyanlu.com/) (my advisor, and probably one of the most brilliant human beings I ever met btw), and collaborating with [Prof. Fu](https://www.fuhuthu.com/) on analyzing Amazon buy-box from a theoretical perspective. Especially, I'm a fan of [Prof. Al Roth](https://web.stanford.edu/~alroth/), of economic [researches in health industry](/posts/kidney/), and [I've started my blog because of his inspiration](/posts/definition/).

### blogs

Here are my favourite posts over the history.

> As an existentialist, I adore Ariana Grande's sweetener philosophy that, "**it's kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone's life or somebody else brings life to your life. Sweetening the situation.**" Take a look at how I Incorporate [Ariana Grande's artistic viewpoints](/posts/b_graph/) into my [work ethics](/posts/just_like_magic/), and [a graduate-level mechanism design course I've TAed during the 2023/24 fall-winter semester](/posts/ta/).

> - I'm not a big fan of research in machine learning yet, but I am realllllllly good at coding. So here's [SHERLOCK](/posts/all_about_sherlock/), a code detector from my machine learning final project, that I kinda enjoyed doing it but will never do such thing again.
