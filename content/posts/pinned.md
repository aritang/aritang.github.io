Hi, my name is Ariana Tang, and this is my blog where I write things about my research, my artistic viewpoints and occasionally my life.

## academic

As a junior undergrad majoring CS in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, my academic pursuits are rooted in the interdisciplinary of **market design** and **algorithmic game theory**, with a particular interest in **information** â€“â€“ to leverage the power and elegance of mathematics to economic theory.

> **I believe that game theorists [also] need to be sensitive to cultural and psychological factors to better understand the incentives and constraints that people face.**
>
> â€“â€“ Alvin Roth

Acute perception, mathematical skills and a deep sense of empathy embodies the essence of a modern economist, and is what I'm committed to becoming.

I'm very fortunate to work as an individual undergraduate researcher in the [Institute for Theoretical Computer Science](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/LlChinese/main.psp) at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics ](https://www.sufe.edu.cn/)(ITCS@SUFE) directed by [**Prof. Pinyan Lu**](http://pinyanlu.com/) (and my advisor, btw). I feel deeply grateful and fortunate to study among outstanding peers, be exposed to frontiers of research and learning from all the brilliant professors I've met and collaborated along the way.

In case you're interested or need somerthing to facilitate our conversation, here are research topics that I have been/am still/will be working on (organized in chronological order):

- deep reinforcement learning in inventory management, and transshipment mechanism design â€“â€“ feat. Jiayu Xu, Wanyu Zhang, Qiushi Han and prof Chaolin Yang.
- analyzing monopolistic competition with search cost (the Pandora Box model, if you'd ever heard of it before) â€“â€“ feat. prof Hu Fu.
- auction design, especially, approximation â€“â€“ feat. prof. Pinyan Lu.
- restless multi-armed bandit and its application in social good â€“â€“ feat. prof Ryan Shi.
- information design in operational management â€“â€“ feat. Chenyu Huang and prof. Bo Jiang.
- antitrust regulation â€“â€“ feat. prof Modibo Camara

I'm a fan of [Prof. Al Roth](https://web.stanford.edu/~alroth/), of economic [researches in health industry](/posts/kidney/), and [I've started my blog because of his inspiration](/posts/definition/).

## blogs

The blog updates on a daily basis. Here are some selected blog posts about ideas worth sharing:

### the **sweetener philosophy**:

> **it's kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone's life or somebody else brings life to your life. sweetening the situation.**

Incorporate a lot of [Ariana Grande's artistic viewpoints](/posts/b_graph/) into my [work ethics](/posts/just_like_magic/):

{{<figure align="center" src="/tattooed_heart/work_ethic.jpeg" caption="the post about [***my work ethics***](/posts/b_graph/): the more authentic and genuine it is, the better it will work for you">}}

And, here are some of my thinkings about [existentialism and the **sweetener Philosophy**](/posts/eternal_sunshine/), and the interesting [study of the **lowercase aesthetic**](/posts/lowercase_aesthetic/).

### interesting things i've read or observed:

Competition and information are two aspects of economics about which I think and write extensively:

> [the paradox of modern connectivity and competition](/posts/antitrust_mega_tech_companies/) â€“â€“ about antitrust.
>
> [*blowing in the wind*](/posts/blowing_in_the_wind/) â€“â€“ about delivery workers trapped in algorithms.
>
> competition consequences: [I](/posts/competitions_consequence/) and [II](/posts/competitions_consequence1/) â€“â€“ about competition.
>
> I write notes about papers I read and talks I listened to. e.g. [*Suspense and Surprise*](/posts/suspense_n_surprise/), by Jeffrey Ely, Alexander Framkel and Emir Kamenica.

And more. Please do try the [search](/search/) buttom in my blog for some keywords that might interest you  â€“â€“ we might strike a chord!

### art and music

I am a very artistically inclined person â€“â€“Â for **fashion** and **music**. Particularly, I write music comments whenever I'm too busy:

> [the deceptive simplicity of Mozart's sonata facile, K.545](/posts/grigory_sokolov/)
>
> Ariana Grande's unreleased music: [who do we blame-for leaking AG's communicate](/posts/communicate/)
>
> flute music: [tango between shadows and light | Histoire du Tango: II. CafÃ© 1930](/posts/history_du_tango_1930/)

and occasionally, art and fashion:

> [once upon a dream, in Met Gala](/posts/once_upon_a_dream/) â€“â€“ about Ariana Grande's performance at 2024 Met Gala, dressed in a breathtakingly beautiful Maison Margiela gown, designed by John Galliano.
>
> [Everything you need to know about Impressionism: how a group of rebel artists 'freed painting'](/posts/monet_on_sale/)
