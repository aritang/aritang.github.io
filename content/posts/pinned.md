Hi, my name is Ariana. This is a personal blog, where I write things about my research, my artistic viewpoints and occasionally my life. You can see my [preference](https://aritang.github.io/posts/sweetener_philosophy/) here. In general, I like music, math, Econ (part of them), delicious food.

Here are my favourite posts over the history. If you wanna get to know a little bit more about me, this is the perfect place to start. And, maybe check the [archive](https://aritang.github.io/archives/) for further fun.

### One and only most favourite post so far:

> [dating w.r.t. oppo. cost](http://localhost:1313/posts/oppoc/)

### Life

> Beautiful moments and memories: the [conversation series](http://localhost:1313/tags/conversations/).

### Research

> I'm a big fan of Al Roth: [on kidney transplant](http://localhost:1313/posts/kidney/).

> I have passion for **health econ** and **market design**. My current focus is **Econ** and **auction theory**. To comment or discuss about research, feel free to shoot a quick email to ariana_tang@outlook.com.

> Generally you can hear a lot of [complaints](http://localhost:1313/tags/complaints/) that I made day to day about things I do, lol.

### Music and Art

> Check the homepage's lyrics. Have you noticed? They change everytime you reload the page.
>
> I'm a fan of Ariana Grande. Will write about her in depth someday.
