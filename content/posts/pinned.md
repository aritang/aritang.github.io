## academic

As a senior undergraduate at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, my research focuses on market design and algorithmic game theory. I'm also interested in EconCS in general.

I am co-advised by Prof. Pinyan Lu and by Prof. Hu Fu at SUFE. I have also had the pleasure of collaborating with Prof. Ryan Shi and Prof. Modibo Camara.

> **I believe that game theorists [also] need to be sensitive to cultural and psychological factors to better understand the incentives and constraints that people face.**

> –– Alvin Roth

Acute perception, mathematical skills and a deep sense of empathy embodies the essence of a modern economist, and is what I'm committed to becoming. And here are the papers:

> Price Stability and Improved Buyer Utility with Presentation Design: A Theoretical Study of the Amazon Buy Box. Ophir Friedler, Hu Fu, Anna Karlin, **Ariana Tang**. Accepted at The Web Conference 2025. [paper pdf](/files/Friedler_et_al_PriceStabilityPresentation-WWW.pdf) [poster](/files/bottle_of_bubbles-poster.pdf)

> Contextual Budget Allocation for Food Rescue Volunteer Engagement. Ariana Tang, Naveen Raman, Fei Fang, and Ryan Shi. Working paper 2025. [paper pdf](/files/ContextualBudgetBandit4FoodRescue_Arxiv.pdf)

## blogs

This blog serves as a gateway into my world of research, creativity, and everyday thoughts. I started it inspired by Alvin Roth's market design blog.

It updates on a daily basis. Here are some selected blog posts about ideas worth sharing:

I love Ariana Grande and the concept that her ***Sweetener*** album delivers:

> **it's kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone's life or somebody else brings life to your life. sweetening the situation.**
