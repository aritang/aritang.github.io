Hi, my name is Ariana Tang, and this is my blog where I write things about my research, my artistic viewpoints and occasionally my life. 

As a junior undergrad student majoring in CS in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, I have broad interest in the interdisciplinary of computer science and economic. Especially, I'm a fan of professor Alvin Roth and economic [researches in health industry](https://aritang.github.io/posts/kidney/), and [I've started my blog because of his inspiration](https://aritang.github.io/posts/definition/).

Here are my favourite posts over the history. If you wanna get to know a little bit more about me, feel free to [email](ariana_tang@outlook.com) me. Maybe check the [archive](https://aritang.github.io/archives/) for further fun.

> As an existentialist, I adore Ariana Grande's sweetener philosophy that, "**it's kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone's life or somebody else brings life to your life. Sweetening the situation.**" Also, [my work ethic](https://aritang.github.io/posts/just_like_magic/) originates from her as well.
