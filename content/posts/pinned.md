Hi, my name is Ariana Tang, and this is my blog where I write things about my research, my artistic viewpoints and occasionally my life.

As a junior undergrad student majoring in CS in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, I have broad interest in the interdisciplinary of computer science and economic, to fuse mathematical elegance, integrate computer science techniques, and adding a blend of humanity. Currently I'm working on auctions with [Prof. Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) (my advisor!), and collaborating with [Prof. Fu](https://www.fuhuthu.com/) on analyzing Amazon buy-box from a theoretical perspective. Especially, I'm a fan of [Prof. Al Roth](https://web.stanford.edu/~alroth/), of economic [researches in health industry](https://aritang.github.io/posts/kidney/), and [I've started my blog because of his inspiration](https://aritang.github.io/posts/definition/).

Here are my favourite posts over the history. Also, feel free to shoot me a message, and to discuss anything: ariana_tang*<u>AT</u>*outlook<u>*dot*</u>com or wechat <u>*LovefromArianaTang*</u>.

> As an existentialist, I adore Ariana Grande's sweetener philosophy that, "**it's kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone's life or somebody else brings life to your life. Sweetening the situation.**" Also, [my work ethic](https://aritang.github.io/posts/just_like_magic/) originates from her as well.
