Our reading group recently wrapped up a sequence of papers under the theme *Beyond Bayesian Bandits* ‚Äî or as I like to think of it, ‚Äú3B.‚Äù (Yes, like the composers: Bach, Beethoven, Brahms. Also sometimes a bit boring.)

Anyway, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve covered so far. For some books and papers I don't attach links but they should be google-able.
