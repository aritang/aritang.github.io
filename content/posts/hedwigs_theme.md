> **Hedwig's Theme** is a leitmotif composed by John Williams for the film adaptation of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. While not exclusively written for the character, it is better known for being the main theme of every Harry Potter film and is iconic for the wizarding world in general. (Harry Potter Wiki)

> Two legends shared the stage this autumn – in a glorious debut, **John Williams** conducted the **Berliner Philharmoniker** for the very first time. ***John Williams – The Berlin Concert\***, captured live by **Deutsche Grammophon** during a series of sold-out concerts, presents some of the world’s best-known film music performed by one of the world’s greatest orchestras. The DG album is out now and released with the renowned composer’s **90th birthday** occurring just four days later (8 February). “John Williams doesn’t need the films, the films need him,” wrote *Rolling Stone* after the concert, while Berlin’s *Der Tagesspiegel* summed up the event as simply “one of those great evenings”.
