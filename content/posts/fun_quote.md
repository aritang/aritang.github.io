I watched and found a very interesting quote on...YouTube. Guess who said it.

> Trying to stop people from doing things that they want to do, doesnâ€™t always stop them.

Sounds like something Hermione Granger said

>  The *best way* to *get people* to *read* something is to *ban* it

Try reading the italicized words in staccato and you'll get the authentic Hermione accent.

OK... just kidding. Al Roth said it in his "big idea" talk on YouTube. It's such an insight, and not only applied to market designers obviously...
