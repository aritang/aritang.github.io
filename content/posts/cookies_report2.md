Taking the premise that there **is** privacy issue with Cookies—some sacrifice between efficiency and privacy is inevitable.

#### How does the industry react:

**Browsers:**

Some browsers take an extreme approach: Safari and Firefox has been blocking Cookies for years. While others are more moderate: Edge doesn't block 3rd party cookies.

**Regulator:**

**GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) initiated in Europe provides comprehensive privacy or data protection reform for not only European residents and European companies, but all companies worldwide that are serving customers in Europe—including **consent** for users to opt-in using personal Cookie data.

#### The landscape and future for online advertising industry. 

The Ad-exchange industry **without** cookies has for main categories (Garret Johnson): 

- Contextual Advertising

    Ads are displayed based on the context of the webpage (e.g., cosmetic ads on Vogue's website).

- 'Cookieless' ID tracking

    Replaces traditional cookies with anonymized versions of email addresses (or, fingerprinting using browser signals and IP addresses)  to track users across websites.

- Walled Gardens

    Platforms like Facebook, Meta, and Amazon that utilize extensive first-party data. They have large enough data base to almost match user preference everything on their own.

- ### [**Privacy Sandbox**](https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/open-web/)

    **Google's initiate attempts to experiment and develop *a collection of alternative technologies* to third-party cookies that protect user privacy while still enabling targeted advertising.**

    What distinguishes Privacy Sandbox from other browsers' approaches is that, they are developing a **collection** of APIs (aka a software that does a specific function) that carry out separate tasks that Cookies does:

    - Ad targeting: [Topics API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/relevance/topics/developer-guide?hl=en), [Protected Audience API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/relevance/protected-audience?hl=en)
    - Ads measurement: [Attribution Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/relevance/attribution-reporting?hl=en)
    - Cyber security: [Related Website Sets API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd/related-website-sets?hl=en)

> Cookieless group performs about 30% worse than the status quo group [with Cookie], and the Privacy Sandbox group performs about 28% worse than the status quo group [with Cookie].
