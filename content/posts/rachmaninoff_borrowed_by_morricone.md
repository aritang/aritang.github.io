The Legend of 1900 (1998) is an Italian English-language film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, starring Tim Roth. It's the story of an orphan music prodigy on a ocean liner who grows up to be a pianist but lived forever on the ship.

Ennio Morricone had a reputation of ***borrowing*** from other composers (see the discussion of [Ennio Morricone's 'Plagiarism'](https://www.filmscoremonthly.com/board/posts.cfm?threadID=52087&forumID=1&archive=0)). The very beginning of "***Before the End***" features a snippet of Rachmaninov Symphony No.2's Adagio:

See if you can tell the similarity. There are more interesting pieces on the original soundtrack album (***Second Crisis*** [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/Ar8dN6jvBys?si=m9zj8mKnaybQkeP2)) and this movie is definitely worth a watch in cinema.
