summary: At times, I resonate with Sisyphus. Yet, although my life involves its share of repetition, I don't always perceive these experiences as suffering or a “struggle”, nor do I believe they need to be.

Albert Camus’s *The Myth of Sisyphus* introduces the concept of Sisyphus being "punished" by eternally pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to watch it roll back down each time.

> The struggle itself to the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. **One must imagine Sisyphus happy.**

At times, I resonate with this sentiment, but occasionally, I find myself hesitant to embrace it fully. Although my life involves its share of repetition, I don't always perceive these experiences as suffering or a “struggle”, nor do I believe they need to be.

This reminds me of a conversation I had with James Wagstaffe during one of our public speaking courses. He mentioned that he has been teaching for over forty years and still finds immense joy in it. Each time he delivers a lecture, he makes slight adjustments for the sake of fun and to keep things fresh. This approach, far from being mundane, adds a delightful twist to the routine.

Nihilism and existentialism are powerful philosophical theories, yet, in the end, we each author our unique narratives anyway.
