## 👏🤦🏻‍♀️👏🤦🏻‍♀️👏🤦🏻‍♀️ 50-years of open problem closed.

Proteins are essentially correctly folded and well-functioning polypeptide chains. So theoretically, protein 3D structures are determined by the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1972) was awarded to C. Anfinsen for this finding.

Since then, determining 3D protein structure has been the grand challenge for biology. Doing it *experimentally* is a way—bascially it's taking photos of proteins, but using X-ray instead of natural light, and also because you have to freeze the object for a nice shot, proteins need to be crystalized—hence, 'X-ray crystallography'. And *NMR spectroscopy*. Both are expensive, experimental, lengthy methods.

AI said, nah you guys are too slow:
