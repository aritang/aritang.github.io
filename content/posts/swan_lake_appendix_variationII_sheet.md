The [Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux](/posts/tchaikovsky_pas_de_deux/) is bouncy, full of energy. Full sheet music can be downloaded at IMSLP. Reading the complete score is really not so convenient (cause all instruments are stacked together):

The female variation has light, crisp and joyful and **consistent** melody that really make up nice orchestra audition snippet. I assemble them, just for reference (although you can probably just memorize the melody after several pass of the music anyway, but just in case):
