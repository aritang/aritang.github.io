Class note from Price Theory course.

Consider an individual looks to buy $m$ goods. Let there be nice assumptions:

- Continuous: that consumption can be expressed as $x\in \R^m$.
- (Strictly?) concave utilities.
- Linear budget: $p\cdot x \le \texttt{Budget}$.

## Back of (a big) envelope

Let $\mathbf x^H(p, u), \mathbf x^M(p, I)$ be the Hicksian and Marshallian demand functions.

If we focus on one single good $i\in [m]$, and with a tiny abuse of notation, we can write
$$
\begin{align*}
& x_i^{H(\bar U, p_{-i})}(p_i) :=x_i^H(p_i, p_{-i}, \bar U)\cr
& x_i^{M(I, p_{-i})}(p_i) :=x_i^M(p_i, p_{-i}, I)
\end{align*}
$$
When economists scribble a downward sloping demand curve on a 2D plane, we are basically holding $(\bar U, p_{-i})$ (or $(I, p_{-i})$) fixed and drawing the Hicksian demand curve $D^H:\lbrace (x_i^H(p_i), p_i)\rbrace$ or Marshallian demand curve: $D^M:\lbrace(x_i^M(p_i), p_i)\rbrace$.

##### *Note*: when the two demand curves ($x^H_i, x^M_i$) are drawn together, I prefer to imagine that they're obtained by start from a point $(p_i, x^\star_i(p_i))$ where $ x_i^{H(\bar U, p_{-i})}(p_i) = x_i^{M(I, p_{-i})}(p_i)$. In this way, the fixed utility level (aka purchasing power, how confusing!) $\bar U$ from the Hicksian demand and budget $I$ from the Marshallian demands should *corresponds* in the way that, under the same price vector (and individual's utility function), they have the same consumption outcome. Starting from the point $(p_i, x^\star_i(p_i))$ where H/M demand curves cross, we draw them:

{{<figure align="center" src="/online/h_m_demands.jpeg" caption="**Figure 1.** If the Hicksian demand curve is *below* the Marshallian demand curve, it's when the *income effect* around $(p, I)$ is positive: $\partial_I\mathbf x^M(p, I) > 0$." width="66%">}}

It's more intuitive to think about the Marshallian demand, but it's more mathematically convenient (and precise) to work around the Hicksian demand. Consider when price drops: $p_i \to p_i'$ and we want to measure the utility gain of the individual. Hicksian demand changes to $x_i^H(p_i')$. Denote the Hicksian demand's *expenditure function* as
$$
e(p, \bar U):=\min_x\lbrace p\cdot x:U(x)\ge \bar U\rbrace.
$$
The expenditure function measures how many dollars the individual need to reach utility level $u$ at prices $p$. Therefore, the change in the expenditure function can be interpreted as the **exact monetary measure of the utility change** due to that price variation. Now, by the envelope theorem (Shephard’s Lemma):
$$
\frac{\partial e(p,u)}{\partial p_i} = x_i^H(p,u).
$$
We have
$$
e(p_i, p_{-i},\bar U) - e(p_i', p_{-i},\bar U) = \int_{p_{i}'}^{p_i} x_i^{H(p_{-i},\bar U)}(s)ds.
$$
Thus, **the area under the Hicksian demand curve** gives the **change in the minimum expenditure required to hold utility constant**, i.e., the **exact monetary measure of the utility change** due to that price variation.

{{<figure align="center" src="/online/h_m_demands_shade.jpeg" caption="**Figure 2.** The *Hicksian area* is the the **exact monetary measure** of the utility change due to price change. The Marshallian area is corrupted by income effect." width="88%">}}

Similarly, let's consider when at price $x_i^\star$ is optimal purchase for $p_i$, but the individual mistakenly buys more, $x_i' > x_i^\star$. The shaded areas w.r.t. the Hicksian demand curve:

{{<figure align="center" src="/online/h_m_demands_shade_1.jpeg" caption="**Figure 3.**" width="66%">}}

is the utility loss (measured in money) from being mistakenly buying $x_i'$ when best option is $x_i^\star$. Beacuse on the Hicksian demand curve each point $(x_i, p_i^H(x_i))$ corresponds *precisely* to the marginal willingness to pay for that quantity, by construction. So, utility loss can be measure as the following intergration:


$$
\text{Utility loss in Money} = \int_{x^\star_i}^{x_i'} [p^H(x) - p_i]\ \text{d}x.
$$

## Now let's wave our hand

It's all about tradeoffs — in economic analysis, a little concession in rigorous gives back a lot more for intuition.

So, let's assume income effect is negligible (e.g. small price changes or quasi-linear utility), we can then use Marshallian demand curve as a substitute of the Hicksian demand curve to ***approximate***ly measure the change in individual's utility as price goes down or up, or when individual's purchase goes wrong. 

###### In other words, we assume a downward sloping demand curve, and we don't really care about the income effect and don't differentiate whether it's Marshallian or Hicksian.

Two interesting conclusions then arise:

### Advertisement

Suppose the seller of product $i$ want to increase their sales from $x_i^\star \to x_i'$ when price is $p_i$. One way he can do it is by lowering price to $p_i'$. In this way, he gains $p_i'x_i' - p_ix_i$, which (approximately) corresponds to $S - T$ (Figure 3.1):

{{<figure align="center" src="/online/h_m_demands_shade_2.jpeg" caption="**Figure 3.1** Note that $D^H$ should eh, be both the Marshallian demand *and* the Hicksian demand." width="66%">}}

That's one way. But let's think outside the box. Let's say, instead of lowering the price, the seller compensate the consumer an amount of  money to buy $x_i'$, which is an undesirable amount if price is $p_i$. Let the compensation be equal to the area of the shade (Figure 3.1)—this amount would exactly makes up the utility loss of the individual who consume $x_i'$ instead of $x_i^\star$ at price $p_i$. In this way, the seller increase sales to $x_i'$ while maintaining price $p_i$ and losing the revenue of the shaded area. In this way, seller's utility increment is $S + R$. So the seller gets jigher revenue :)

##### In fact, $S + R$ can be *MUCH* bigger than $S - T$ if you consider the price and demand changes are small — then $S + R$ would dominate $S - T$ with an order.

I think this is perhaps the most minimalistic elegant justification for the advertisement industry!

A side argument also tells something about **shopping**: you don't lose a lot when you buy too much! (only the triangular shaded area) But you're a moron if you buy expensive. We call them 水鱼.

### Loss of insufficient information (deceptions), and regulation

Let's say the seller lies about product $i$'s quality. The demand curve under fake info is $D'$ would lies **above** the true demand curve.

{{<figure align="center" src="/online/demand_lie.jpeg" caption="**Figure 4.** *Assumption DD*: these two demand curves' vertical gap is constant $p'(x_i) - p(x_i) \equiv c, \forall x_i$." width="66%">}}

Under the lie, when the product's really crappy but individuals buy more than they should: $(x_i', p_i)$. A regulator can either 

- Force the seller to tell the truth. Then the individual goes back to buy $x_i^\star$ and the utility gain from resolving the truth of the product is area $A$ (Figure 4).

- However, if the seller is forced to *increase* his product quality so that it supports $D'$. Then individuals now really are happy to buy $x_i'$ amount under price $p_i$, and the utility gain would equal to the area $B + C$ (Figure 4).

    {{<figure align="center" src="/online/demand_lie_1.jpeg" caption="**Figure 4.1** The utility gain from increasing product quality so that demand curve $D$ move to $D'$, is equal to area $B+C$ (Figure 4) under *Assumption DD* that the demand curves' vertical gap is **constant**." width="66%">}}
