As November draws to a close, here's a photograph that brings a winkâ€”a moment of two ginger friends' ...scooter seatsâ€”reminding us all to slow down and take in the view.

To my friends and whoever come to this page, thank you for being in my life, and every bit of help really do keep me grounded while I navigate everything.

Happy end of November and cheers to the holiday season ahead! ðŸŽ„ The blog takes a little holiday too today. See you soon with more updates, ideas, and perhaps more cats.
