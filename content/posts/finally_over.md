### Parkinsonâ€™s Law

In his essay from 1955 C. Northcote Parkinson described in a short essay in *Economist:*

> It is a commonplace observation that **work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion**. Thus, an elderly lady of leisure can spend an entire day in writing and dispatching a postcard to her niece at Bognor Regis. An hour will be spent in finding the postcard, another in hunting for spectacles, half-an-hour in a search for the address, an hour and a quarter in composition, and twenty minutes in deciding whether or not to take an umbrella when going to the pillar-box in the next street. The total effort which would occupy a busy man for three minutes all told may in this fashion leave another person prostrate after a day of doubt, anxiety and toil. Granted that work (and especially paper work) is thus elastic in its demands on time.

And no wonder that tmrw is the final deadline of my finals this semester, that I didn't finish it until just now tonight. The final is finally over.
