From Medium, by Maria Cassano "[I’m a Professional Editor and These Phrases Tell Me You Used ChatGPT](https://medium.com/writing-cooperative/im-a-professional-editor-and-these-phrases-tell-me-you-used-chatgpt-23236708918f)":

The author gives a pretty nice hypothesis (and possibly true) for why ChatGPT tends to write this way:

> Large language models like ChatGPT are primarily trained on publically available [text from the internet](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-foundation-models-are-developed). Yes, that includes some good writing — but for every high-quality piece, you’ll find hundreds of generic listicles, crappy blog posts, spammy articles, keyword-stuffed nonsense, and amateur essays with no views.

In other words, garbage in, garbage out. What's worse is that nowadays the Internet is being flooded by more and more AI craps.

Some tips for real writers:

> Beginners believe that fancy, wordy language impresses readers. Professionals know that writing is a [form of communication](https://writingcooperative.com/as-a-professional-editor-i-can-strengthen-any-writing-using-6-rules-ad9e11553c2b), and communication should be as straightforward as possible.

> A few of these phrases won’t make or break your work, but when most of them are present in the same article, it tells your editor two things: You used ChatGPT as a shortcut (not a springboard), and you have no interest in mastering your craft as a writer.
