I got tired of reading papers after papers so today I went on all the profiles of the authors of the read papers so as to find something interesting. While browsing Professor Negin Golrezaei's profile, I stumbled upon a series of captivating reports delving into the fierce competition that Amazon shops face.

Two of the most fascinating ones are from BuzzFeed News:

1. **"Some Amazon Sellers Paying $10,000 Monthly to Game the Rankings"** ([Read Here](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leticiamiranda/amazon-marketplace-sellers-black-hat-scams-search-rankings))
2. **"Inside Amazon's Fake Review Economy"** ([Read Here](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem?bfsource=relatedmanual))

It's really sad but also hilarious. Moreover, an increasing number of Chinese producers are entering the market, opening stores on Amazon, and using international shipping to fulfill their orders. They're introducing a malicious style of competition, reminiscent of Taobao's practices, which could marginalize local family-owned brands not adept at advertising and navigating this unscrupulous terrain. It's genuinely distressing to witness.

Residing in the bustling consumer-driven hub of Shanghai, I'm all too accustomed to witnessing this type of market failure, where shops often churn out uninspiring counterfeits, focused on fast cash, and pour excessive resources into promotions.

We need the intelligence of some market designers (or Amazon/Taobao engineers) to bring about change. Personally, it irks me to see genuinely innovative businesses being outcompeted because they're doing things the right way, while sneaky counterfeit copycats take shortcuts.

Sometimes, I bear this kind of attitude that "these shits are all none of my business" and be like, as Doja Cat's *Attention* (wow i'm really into this song):

> I'm sorry, but we all find it really entertaining
>
> 'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
>
> And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
>
> Not be in it, but ain't the bad press good?

Yet, it's not entirely entertaining, because we're also living within this turbulent environment.
