I've recently stumbled across a photographer Chaoming Zeng (曾朝民) on instagram, whose base is also Guangdong China, but more in the rural area like Dong-guan. Here's the particular work that really took my breath away:

Personally, I am deeply attached to my hometown  **Guangzhou**, of the vibrant yet chaotic essence, a raw, unpolished vitality that roots itself deeply in the everyday lives of its inhabitants. It's a spirit of authenticity, characterized by a profound acceptance and connection to life, in dichotomy steeply with the ephemeral, ostentatious veneer of Shanghai (that I almost got sick of, really). 

Chaoming's photographs amplify such feelings, reflecting a beautiful yet extended ease of life, representing the essence of Guangdong that makes the city inclusive, magical, and a great place to truly live and feel grounded.
