Franz Schubert was born today 229 years ago. He composed more than 1500 works in his short career (He died 1828, aged 31)

Some of my favourites include *Die Forelle*, and the *Impromptus* (No. 3 in G Flat Major). 

Schubert's foremost contribution is his Lieders (art songs). The Winterreise was composed just one year before his pass away. Listen to Thomas Quasthoff & Daniel Barenboim performing *Gute Nacht*.
