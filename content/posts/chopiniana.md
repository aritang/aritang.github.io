"Chopiniana," also known as "Les Sylphides," is a ballet choreographed by Mikhail Fokine, set to music by **Frédéric Chopin**, and premiered in 1907 as a "romantic reverie". It's a ***ballet blanc***—where all ballerinas wear white dresses or tutus.

The music is very beautiful. And the choreography has magic.

> Fokine’s *Chopiniana* is an homage to the Romantic era with its white ballet, fleeting arabesques, airy dances of ethereal sylphides and perpetual longing for perfection. Fokine, inspired by antique engravings depicting the legendary Marie Taglioni and her contemporaries and weary of ballet virtuosity and technique show offs, created a storyless ballet sketch at the beginning of the 20th century. The sketch was **“in the style of that long-forgotten time when ballet was governed by poetry, when a dancer rose *en pointe* not to demonstrate the steel-like arch of her foot but in order to create the impression of lightness, barely touching the ground, something ethereal and fantastical.”** The choreographer wrote: “I have tried not to surprise people with the newness, but rather to restore conventional ballet dancing to the point of its greatest advances. I don’t know if this is how our ballet predecessors danced. And no-one else knows that. But in my dreams this is precisely how they did dance.” [source: Mariinsky Theatre](https://www.mariinsky.ru/en/playbill/repertoire/ballet/chopin/#)

I was there when the Mariinsky Ballet toured Shanghai, performing *Chopiniana*. At the time, I didn’t find it particularly astounding and just managed to sit through the performance.

It’s strange how often beauty slips past us just like this. We move through moments blindly, only to find their significance illuminated in retrospect—like a dream we wake from, only to realize it was real all along.
