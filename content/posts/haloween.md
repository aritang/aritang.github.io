Shanghai ranks among China's top international cities, alongside Hong Kong. Being an undergrad student in Shanghai, my friend and I represent a significant chunk of the city's active consumer base, i.e. we contribute substantially to its vibrant atmosphere and GDP.

Shanghai residents genuinely embrace international cultures, with a strong preference for North American influences. European styles, particularly those from Italy and France, also enjoy popularity. Some venture into Mexican or Latino influences, while others delve into East Asian elements like Zen culture from Japan or Korean pop culture. The Little Red Book app, similar to Instagram, serves as a platform for young people to share their "foreign lifestyle" experiences. It's quite amusing, as some consider eating burgers and bagels as a symbol of a fancy, high-class lifestyle (ewww, seriously?). In terms of price they are symbolizing US food price indeed... Bagels, which cost around ¥8-30, barely pass as a breakfast item due to their small size, and a burger for ¥60 or more is standard (in contrast to the filling and budget-friendly 生煎包, pronounced Sheng-Jian-Bao, a type of fried meat bun, which costs about ¥15 per share).

Shanghai's young folks are also enthusiastic about celebrating foreign festivals, primarily mainstream ones like Halloween and, of course, Christmas. I often wonder if they might adopt more in-depth celebrations, such as Thanksgiving, though it's quite clear that Hanukkah and Day of the Dead are not on the radar.

It's entertaining to witness the shallowness, yet there's a possibility that young people are seeking diversions. The underlying motivation is straightforward—many aspire to travel or live abroad, but not everyone can afford it. It's akin to purchasing luxury handbags.

Nonetheless, Halloween is a blast. I've already attend one open Halloween dress-up parties, and maybe I'll drop by my advisor's office hours tomorrow for some trick-or-treat prank. Just for fun, not criticizing.
