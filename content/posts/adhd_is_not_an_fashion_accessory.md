It’s that time of year again—graduate-entrance exams have just wrapped up, and for many people around me it’s a moment of reflection (or panic) as they contemplate what comes next. Amidst the usual stress and sleepless nights, another topic has quietly stirred debates among the community of exam-takers: the rise of so-called IQ-booster pills.

Yes I’m talking about **Methylphenidate**—aka **Ritalin**.

### Real Quick Fact Check: ADHD, Ritalin, and Neurotransmitters

For those unfamiliar, Ritalin is a prescription-only medication primarily used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). It works by modulating dopamine and norepinephrine levels in specific parts of the brain, calming overactivity to help those with ADHD focus better.

Let’s clear up some common confusion about ADHD medications:

1. **Amphetamine**: A widely used ADHD drug that’s potent but highly addictive with significant side effects (not exactly the kind of “brain booster” one would expect for casual use).

2. **Methylamphetamine**: Looks similar but not quite in terms of functionality. It’s commonly known as meth—that illegal one.

3. **Methylphenidate (Ritalin)**: The star of today’s debate. While it’s less addictive and generally considered safer than amphetamines, it’s still not without risks—side effects range from insomnia to potential dependency.

However, students and even some anxious parents are reportedly eyeing this drug as a quick fix to boost academic performance.

### China's Strict Regulation

In China, **Methylphenidate** is tightly controlled with very limited number of clinical institutions able to prescribe it. Selling it illegally is as seriously a felony as selling hardcore drugs like Methylamphetamine (meth). 

There’s a small yet vocal group suggesting that it’s time to relax these regulations, perhaps taking Ritalin should be as easy and socially acceptable as grabbing a morning coffee—so it will be made accessible to real ADHD patients in need. 

I don't think the issue would be this simple. Here’s my take: there are too many incentives for people to abuse these performance-booster drugs. I’ve heard of (and sadly believe) cases where parents buy these pills for their children to boost exam performance. This is not just unethical; it’s outright dangerous, especially under China’s high-pressure academic environment that creates a breeding ground for such practices. The relentless pursuit of academic perfection makes all player—from college kids to parents—particularly vulnerable to the allure of a “magic cure.”

One more thing, instead of looking for quick fixes, maybe it’s also time to focus on sustainable solutions—like better mental health support, rethinking our obsession with academic rankings, and building healthier attitudes toward success.
