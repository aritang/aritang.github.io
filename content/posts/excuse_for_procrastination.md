As title suggested, here's an excerpt from ***Eugene Onegin*** Chapter 3's ending:

> But today, dear friends,
>
> I'm too exhausted to relate
>
> the sequel to this unlooked-for meeting
>
> After so long a narrative I must
>
> go for a stroll and have a rest
>
> I'll finish of my story later somehow.

See you tmrw!
