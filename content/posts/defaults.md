Following [the previous discussion](/posts/grad_school_enrollment_in_china/) about the problematic post-graduate admission system. Fudan University (**FDU**)'s School of Management announced the students who defaulted their offers

{{<figure align="center" src="/pilot_class_market/defaults_eng.jpeg" caption="FDU university annouced the **name and their undergraduate affiliation** of the students who defaulted their offer. (translated version) original archived [here](/pilot_class_market/defaults_original.jpeg). original [link](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/upec/upec1556954679253)." width="100%">}}

It happens every year, everywhere. FDU chose to list the students as a threat but it doesn't seem to work well because the list of name grows longer year by year...

**FDU's** School of Management offer arguebly one of the top master programs in China. These students must have very strong alternativesâ€”no wonder Peking university topped the chart, flying three pigeons this year. 

Two of the students come from my universityðŸ¤£. One of whom I know, didn't default the offer to go to another universityâ€”instead, he landed himself in BCG. Maybe he will and should learn the virtue of commitment at some point of his life. But everybody has their own considerations and constraints. Congratulations, anyway.
