Steinway-piano dot com has the story of the meeting of the two perhaps most influential musicians among the piano community of the first half of the 20th century.

## Horowitz: the rising of a star

> Vladimir Horowitz and Sergei Rachmaninoff had each suffered great losses in the Russian Revolution of 1917. “We lost absolutely everything,” Horowitz told author, radio personality, and Steinway Artist David Dubal, as reported in Dubal’s book, *[Reflections from the Keyboard](http://books.google.com/books/about/Reflections_from_the_keyboard.html?id=VfgXAQAAIAAJ).* “In 24 hours, all we had we lost.”

> In 1925, he traveled to Germany and then to Paris, performing to tremendous acclaim. In Hamburg, he played the [Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._1_(Tchaikovsky)) as a last-minute replacement for an indisposed pianist; conductor Eugene Pabst was so astonished by the power and speed of his playing that he left the podium to watch Horowitz’s hands. He had been booked to perform two recitals in small halls in Paris, but the response was so spectacular that he had to play five recitals, the last one at the Paris Opera. American concert manager Arthur Judson heard of him in Paris in 1928 and signed him up for a tour in the United States.

Horowitz made his US debut at Carnegie Hall in the Tchaikovsky First Piano. The conductor Thomas Beecham, also debuting taht night, were somehow more ***relaxed*** and went with a slower pace at the start. Horowitz, anxious in attempting to launch his reputation, decided to show off his ability of "play it with such speed and noise" took his step, let go and almost eat the public alive.

> Beechman tried to keep up, but he was taken by surprise and couldn’t quite make it work. Horowitz later said, without a hint of remorse, “We ended almost together.” The public found the pianist electrifying, and his American career was assured.

## the friendship in Steinway-hall

Horowitz's debut concert was, not short of exceptional audience

> Sergei Rachmaninoff was in the audience that night, but he wasn’t pleased with what he had heard. Horowitz reported to Dubal that Rachmaninoff told him, “Your octaves are the fastest and loudest, but I must tell you, it was not musical. It was not necessary.” So Horowitz recounted the story of how the performance had unfolded, and Rachmaninoff began to laugh. “But Rachmaninoff could always find something to complain about in any performance,” said Horowitz.

> The two wasted no time in becoming musical acquaintances. Rachmaninoff played Medtner’s Fairy Tale in E Minor for Horowitz. Then the two decided that if Horowitz was going to perform Rachmaninoff’s Third Piano Concerto, perhaps the composer should give him some pointers. Off they went to Steinway Hall. **Rachmaninoff played the orchestra part on one [Steinway piano](http://www.steinwaygrand.com/), while Horowitz played the solo part on another.**

And there comes one of the best interpreter of Rach's piano concerto no.3:

> [Rachmaninoff] “He had the courage, the intensity, and daring that make for greatness.”
>
> The Rachmaninoff concerto became Horowitz’s trademark. His New York performance of the work, with the Philharmonic Orchestra, was broadcast over the radio.

> The two musical giants remained friends for the rest of their lives. Horowitz case to be known as the pianist who “owned” the difficult Third Piano Concerto. And it all began in the basement of New York’s Steinway Hall.
