Spending four years of undergrad in Shanghai feels like a kind of luxury. One big reason is how incredibly accessible and convenient transportation is. The city is deeply interconnected — a feature that, in many ways, makes up for a lot of the everyday frustrations of urban life.

Shanghai has four major train stations the size of airports, plus two actual airports. I’ve visited all of them. But Shanghai **South** Railway Station stands out the most to me — especially in terms of design and aesthetics.

First, it's super chic — Shanghai South Railway Station feels more like an airport than a train station. Its **circular** layout isn’t just eye-catching — it’s unified, symmetrical, and whole. Nothing feels fragmented. The glass-and-steel dome overhead lets in natural light, reminding me of an I. M. Pei design: elegant, airy, and modern.

What really impressed me is how the station guides movement. It’s not just efficient — it’s actually pleasant. I entered from one of the many access points around the outer ring. After the standard ticket and security checks, I was on an elevated circular path lined with food stalls and souvenir shops. It felt more like a weekend stroll through a shopping mall than a rushed commute.

{{<figure align="center" src="/wabisabi/shanghai-sud_gare_3.jpeg" caption="[Source: AERP.](https://www.arep.fr/en/our-projects/shanghai-train-station/) First you enter at the outer cycle, for leisure walk, toilet hunt and shopping." width="100%">}}

It's like a mall. Once you're done browsing or eating, you descend into the inner, lower circle of the station to board your train.

The circular design is brilliant because it allows people to move freely — clockwise, counterclockwise, it doesn’t matter. You can take your time, explore a little, and still end up where you need to be without accidentally walking in the wrong direction (a frustrating flaw in many large airports).

Just a few days ago, I was at an exhibition on I. M. Pei’s public space designs. One quote stuck with me: good public design, he said, is somewhere you’d want to bring your family on a weekend — not because you have to be there, but because it’s a joy to be in the space. Shanghai South Railway Station really hits that mark!
