*Sideways* is a movie about wine. "Two men reaching middle age with not much to show but disappointment, embark on a week-long road trip through Californiaʼs wine country, just as one is about to take a trip down the aisle."

The movie was a huge success on a petite budget. It was made on a **$16 million** budget but earned over $100 million at the box office worldwide. The movie has 5 nominations and won "best adapted screenplay" at the 77th Academy Award (2005). Moreover, its success influenced California's viticulture in a substantial and unexpected way.

It's light and thoughtful, infused with a strong dose of realism that gives the movie its humor and depth. Here's a popular clip (that is not a spoiler):

I shall mute for now. One more sentence of talking would be a spoiler. But, the movie is 5-star recommended. Here's its trailer:
