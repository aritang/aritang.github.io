Working as teaching assistant for college mathematics or general mathematically inclined courses turns out to be not as trivial a task as I've thought it to be. This semester I'm TAing for ***Advanced Optimization***. It's an obligatory course required for sophomore students that I've also took last year. Moreover, I took an even more advanced version of it––convex optimization––while I was visiting Stanford last summer. However, teaching and tutoring turns out not to be something that comes out of thin air. I thought I can just do the assignments and gradings within minutes, give the recitation session without any efforts or too much investment in preparing––turns out the truth is quite the opposite.

Some might says

> Teaching can't be taught.

Well, maybe, *great* teaching is like art and perhaps requires talent. However, **good** teaching can be taught. And let's discuss it. I plan to search online for TA handbooks and conduct, and interview my cohort and friends of how they managed to do the job. Stay tuned!
