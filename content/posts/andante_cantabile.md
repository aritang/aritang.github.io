> ***Andante cantabile***(It.) is a direction often used by composers. In general, it means flowing and songlike.

> The **andante** tempo is known as the walking pace, and the pacing and energy should generally feel like a nice stroll.
>
> **Cantabile** [kanˈtaːbile], an Italian word, means literally **"singable" or "songlike"**. In instrumental music, it is a particular style of playing designed to imitate the human voice.

> To a large section of the public, however, it means one work, the 2nd movt., *andante cantabile*, of Tchaikovsky's str. qt. No.1 in D (1871), Op.11.

And there is other existing beautiful *andante cantabile*s as well. Recorded 2004 by the duo Emmanuel Pahud & Eric Le Sage, of an arranged version of ***Violin Sonata Op. 18 in E flat (arr. for flute): II Improvisation (andante cantabile)***. Released May 15 2024, now [available in Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/violin-sonata-op-18-in-e-flat-for-flute-ii-improvisation/695902473?i=695902485).

The musical term does have a richer intepretation––it's not simply a tempo direction. I'm starting to adopt it as the pace of my life, at least for now. And it sounds much better than presto.
