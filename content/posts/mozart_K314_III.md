Music for the weekend: Mozart's **Flute Concerto** No. 2 in D major, K. 314. A bit of history lesson:

> Dutch [flautist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flautist) [Ferdinand Dejean](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ferdinand_Dejean&action=edit&redlink=1) (1731–1797) commissioned Mozart for four [flute quartets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute_quartet) and three flute concerti, of which Mozart only completed three quartets and one new flute concerto (K.313 in G major). Instead of creating a new second concerto, Mozart [rearranged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement) the oboe concerto he had written a year earlier as the second flute concerto, although with substantial changes for it to fit with what the composer deemed flute-like. However, Dejean did not pay Mozart for this concerto because it was based on the oboe concerto.

This is Pahud's rendition in **2001 Europakonzert from Istanbul with Mariss Jansons and Emmanuel Pahud**—first half of the 3rd movt. I love the lyricism, joy and a sense of playfulness under delicate control and excellent technique—good to see that the conductor and the soloist having fun. And of course, Pahud's charisma.

Particularly, at 1:49 the tiny disjoint in tempo between the orchestra and the soloist is cute.
