{{<figure align="center" src="/tattooed_heart/work_ethic.jpeg" caption="inspiration taken from this Ariana Grande interview, which was shoot around the beginning of her sweetener era i believe? the sweetener philosophy serves a core of my central personality, so this is pretty much me, in certain aspects at least, with a few substitutes of references here and there.">}}

> "A 90s' baby catapulted into this cloud of polished pop dust, and then six million different personalities sing a bunch of harmonies together." That's how I will describe myself.

> I love working. I get a day off and I'm, confused. I'm like, huh, cause i'll have to do something.

> In this industry, a lot of people can tell you a lot of different things, and, to be a different things or to sound a different way. I think that you have to just listen to what's inside, instead.

> Think I've kind of learned that **the more authentic and genuine it is, the better it will work for you**.

> I'll never truly feel like: okay, now I have made it, now I can stop. It's gonna take such a long time for me to ever reach that satisfaction because, I don't know what I would do without music.
>
> I'm very grateful to be here, and that kind of overpowers any of the negative elements that come with, fame I guess.
