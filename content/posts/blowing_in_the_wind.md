It is becoming easier for non-college graduates to settle for a job in metropolitans, ***thanks*** to the growing platform economy that lowers the bar for job entry. As netizen jokes for the go-to job choices, about the three so-called auspicious opportunities: **security, cleaning, insurance sellers** and the challenging ironman triathlon: **takeout delivery, courier, uber driver**".

> Today, as digitization sweeps across the globe, the digital-intergrative industries, notably takeaway delivery, express delivery and uber drivers have rapidly become integral to China's economic landscape. These sectors have not only transformed consumer habits and lifestyles but have also become crucial in the job market. Reports suggest that these industries act as stabilizers for employment in China, especially during economic fluctuations, by providing numerous job opportunities. However, this trend also prompts deeper reflection: Should a country's employment depend heavily on these sectors? Does this reliance indicate an imbalance in economic development?

From the employee's perspective, the work intensity in sectors such as takeaway and courier services is notably high, and labor protections are often insufficient. Many workers endure long hours, unstable incomes, and a lack of social security benefits. Additionally, the relatively low skill requirements associated with these industries do not support the long-term career development of the workforce.

Take a higher view, over-reliance on specific industries, particularly low-end services such as takeaways and express delivery, can indicate an imbalance in economic development. This disparity is evident not only in the industrial framework but also in the labor market structure.

Platform economic flourishes, but maybe the platforms should be more aware of their social responsibilities. Now that they are somewhat too concentrated on (or perhaps, trapped in) the revenue objective. Digitalization and algorithmic optimization on one hand, boost efficiency and facilitate the industry, on the other hand, they trigger involution and suppressed the surplus space of the workers and consumers. Who is to blame for the growing discontent, hostility, collision of interest, and even tragedies observed on all these platforms? 

In the end, it's growing more like a bad equilibrium, trapping almost everyone inside a digital siege.
