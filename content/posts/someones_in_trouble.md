A Bilibili influencer recently posted a scathing critique of a major Chinese streaming app’s advertising practices — calling out the flood of ads, shady tactics, and outright ad fraud.

### Takeaways


- **Ads on logos — yes, really** 
  
  Some apps even slap ads directly on their logos just to squeeze out more exposure.

    > These logo-banner ads even show up in the App Store. Imagine Apple spending decades perfecting its ecosystem, only to have Chinese apps free-riding on their storefront real estate. Tim Cook probably couldn’t have imagined this level of “creativity.”
  
- **Ads are everywhere** 
  
  Within just five minutes of “normal” usage, one see **50+ ads** shoved in your face. Opening the app? Banner ad. Pause a video? Another ad. Even the **弹幕** (bullet comments) have ads.
  
- **Ad fraud is real**...
  
  The influencer uncovered a **1.7-second inflation** on 90-second video ads.
  
  These opening ads can cost up to **¥456 per 1,000 views per 15 seconds**. With **365 billion monthly active events**, this translates into **over $10 billion** in extra revenue.

Intransparent sales channels. Complicated pricing. Implicit and explicit ad fraud. 
All sounds not well. But the worst part is, **this sheer volume of ads is invading every corner of our attention.**  

I think the industry has been stuck in a bullshit equilibrium of “whatever this is,” and it’s unsustainable. If they don’t fix it, they’ll lose users — not just to competitors, but even to **pirate sites** that ironically offer a better viewing experience.

Here's the OG video (in Chinese, with translatable subtitles)
