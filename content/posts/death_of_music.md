I was on a flight back to Shanghai when I read an article about Rose (from BlackPink) and her new song, **“APT,”** featuring Bruno Mars. 

> I was smitten after a single listen. The sound was mesmerizing. After first hearing the song, I found myself humming the chorus wherever I went. I was hardly the only one. Presumably, a considerable number of readers are still captive to that spell. You know the chorus I'm talking about: a-pa-teu, a-pa-teu, a-pa-teu, a-pa-teu...

APT has been a massive commercial hit—no. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100—but honestly, I think it’s *overrated*. Not because Rose lacks talent—she’s fantastic in the MV and with her vocals—but because the song itself feels like soulless, fast-food pop.

I don’t completely blame her or her label. In today’s hyper-competitive market, it makes sense to push catchy, brainwashing tunes that take off quickly. Here are a few reasons why this keeps happening:

1. **Easy Production:** Anyone with a phone and laptop can record and release music. The market is completely oversaturated.
2. **Viral Platforms:** TikTok and YouTube let low-quality songs spread like wildfire. You no longer need a fancy studio or major-label backing.
3. **Popularity Rules:** Streams and ad revenue reward songs people play on repeat. The simpler and catchier the hook, the faster it sticks.

As a result, artists often aim for songs that get stuck in your head right away, rather than music that takes time to appreciate. That’s why we see a flood of shallow, repetitive tracks dominating the charts.

I still admire Rose—she’s a great artist. But “APT” just isn’t for me. The worst part is, I can’t stop humming its chorus anyway.
