Here's a list of to-read papers, books, and blogs. I'll be updating you on my thoughts and insights both during and after I finish each one. And before finishing at least half of the list, I promise not to be wasting any time on Instagram or any e-commerce shopping platform.

### On Search Costs and Platforms

A fascinating collection of papers intersecting econ and CS.

> **Ngwe et al. 2019, "The Impact of Increasing Search Frictions on Online Shopping Behavior: Evidence from a Field Experiment"**.
>
> **H. Tai Lam, "Platform Search Design and Market Power"**
>
> **Submitted Paper: "Improve Buyer Utility with Search Frictions: A Case Study of the Amazon Buy Box"**

### Potentially Interesting Papers and Books

> **Camara 2023, ACM SIGecom Exchanges, "Tractable Choice"**
>
> **He et al. 2021, ACM SIGecom Exchanges, "Exploiting Social Media for Fake Reviews: Evidence from Amazon and Facebook"**
>
> **[Misunderstandings: False Beliefs in Communication by Georg Weizs√§cker](http://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/2023/11/misunderstandings-false-beliefs-in.html)**

And of course, there's Al's Two-Sided Matching Textbook. Plus, a heap of textbooks on machine learning, statistics, stochastic processes, OM, and more. It's going to be a challenging but rewarding journey. Wish me luck!
