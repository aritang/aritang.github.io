The New York Times has outdone itself with [a comprehensive guide to ***N.Y.C. Holiday*** events](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/arts/nyc-holiday-events-guide.html?unlocked_article_code=1.d04.hyPm.nVmnSR3q8crR&smid=url-share)—ballet, opera, and philharmonic picks that will make you wish you were sipping hot cocoa under the Rockefeller tree already.

First up, the pièce de résistance:

## The Nutcracker

{{<figure align="center" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/27holiday-events-qlgz/27holiday-events-qlgz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp" caption="George Balanchine choreographed Nutcracker" width="100%">}}

> At Lincoln Center’s David H. Koch Theater, the New York City Ballet will present its annual “[George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker”](https://www.nycballet.com/season-and-tickets/george-balanchines-the-nutcracker/george-balanchines-the-nutcracker/) (Nov. 29-Jan. 4), with more than 125 children in two alternating casts from the School of American Ballet and a one-ton Christmas tree that grows to more than 40 feet tall.

Ah, nothing screams Christmas like sugar-plum fairies twirling on stage. But if traditional Nutcrackers aren’t your cup of eggnog, NYC has you covered with some modern spins:

> Brooklyn will see a bevy of works reimagining the classic. Two are hip-hop ballet versions, with [“The Brooklyn Nutcracker”](https://www.brooklynballet.org/events-and-tickets/brooklyn-nutcracker) at The Theater at City Tech (Dec. 12-15) and [“The Hip-Hop Nutcracker”](https://www.kingstheatre.com/events/hip-hop-nutcracker/) at Kings Theater (Dec. 23). “[The Hard Nut](https://www.bam.org/holiday/2024/the-hard-nut)” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (Dec. 12-22) sees the story through a lens of witty cartoon Americana.

And a jazzy Tchaikovsky to spice things up:

> At the intimate Dizzy’s Club overlooking Central Park, holiday programming includes Matt Wilson’s “Christmas Tree-O” (Dec. 16), Joe McCarthy’s Afro-Latin big band version of “The Nutcracker Suite” (Dec. 17-18), the pianist and composer Christian Sands’ quartet (Dec. 21-24).

### Opera: the family-friendly Magic Flute

This production is all charm, with its whimsical puppets and abridged Mozart highlight. Perfect for opera newbies or those still recovering from the existential crisis caused by *Don Giovanni*.

> The Metropolitan Opera will present its annual *family-friendly, abridged version of Mozart’s "[The Magic Flute](https://www.metopera.org/season/2024-25-season/the-magic-flute/),* with the director Julie Taymor’s signature fantastical puppets (Dec. 12-Jan. 4).

I am curious, why wasn’t the original opera considered family-friendly? Mozart doesn't write swear words after all, a mystery for the ages...

### And for the classical connoisseurs...

David Geffen Hall delivers the goods:

> At David Geffen Hall, the New York Philharmonic will perform Handel’s [“Messiah”](https://www.nyphil.org/concerts-tickets/2425/handel-messiah/) conducted by Ton Koopman (Dec. 11-14), and a sampler of holiday music in [“Sounds of the Season”](https://www.nyphil.org/concerts-tickets/2425/sounds-of-the-season/) (Dec. 14 and 15). The Philharmonic will also present [“‘Elf’ in Concert,”](https://www.nyphil.org/concerts-tickets/2425/film-elf/) screenings of the Will Ferrell comedy with a live performance of its score (Dec. 19-22).

Handel’s *Messiah* might be tradition, but a live orchestra playing *Elf* really peak holiday spirit with a touch of joyfully absurd humor...

How I wish I can be in NY during Christmas season🥹—if not for stacked final exams. Until then, let me update you with Shanghai’s winter guide: crisp air, golden leaves, and the kind of charm that makes you want to sip coffee while contemplating life (or just trying to dodge tourist crowds on the Bund). Stay tuned!
