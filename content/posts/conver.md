It’s cheat day of the week, let’s do something special.

I have some memories of enlightening conversations - moments between friends that resonate with truth and wisdom. Here’s one, and there’ll be more of them in the future.

> Me: u know, i have had a very tumultuous era of my life, lost and bored. the solution then was retail therapy. so i used to shop a lot, like really hours and hours walking aimlessly between fancy stores.

> Him: (chuckles) I can picture that. Do you still do that these days?

> Me: well it has evolved. now i switched online. it’s much faster... in terms of trading your monthly allowance for dopamine.

> Him: (laughs) true true. But Ariana, consider shifting some of your spendings towards, say, experiences. Perhaps even like flying business class occasionally. Seize the momentum. Look upwards.

> Me: fair enough. but that’s not an excuse for u wearing that free EE merch over and over again btw…
