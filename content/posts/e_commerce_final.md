As I'm rushing through my final week, let me share about the E-commerce course I took this semester‚Äîour instructor commissioned two optional topics for its final thesis. Thinking about them is some fun exercise:

1. Analyze the difference between e-commerce and traditional commerce in terms of product flow mechanisms‚Äîdiscuss your understanding of e-commerce risk management specific measures. How to solve problems when (i) platforms abuse the use of big data technology, for example, to conduct price discrimination; and (ii) platforms abuse their market power to limit seller's multi-homing behavior and force exclusive commitment.
2. How will the innovation of the third-party logistics models solve the problem of ‚Äúthe last kilometer fulfillment‚Äù? How does the development of e-commerce circulation promote the solution of the problem of insufficient and unbalanced development in China? Please elaborate via examples.

Enjoyü§Ø.
