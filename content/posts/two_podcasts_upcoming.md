I recently came across two interesting podcasts that I plan to summarize and comment on. Today has been busy so let me mark them here:

- Can Academic Fraud Be Stopped? (Update). Jan 1 2025, Freakonomics. [Link](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/can-academic-fraud-be-stopped-update/).
- Voting Mechanisms. Aug 31 2020, Data Skeptics. [Link](https://podcasts.apple.com/cn/podcast/data-skeptic/id890348705?i=1000489647682).

Also updated in the procrastination bulletin :D
