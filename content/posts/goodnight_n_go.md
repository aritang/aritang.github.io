Ariana Grande's "*goodnight n go*" has an incredibly special place in my heart. It's not just a song; it's an emotional journey that I embark on every time I listen to it. At first, I was drawn to its dreamy and beautiful melody, and it quickly became my second favorite song. However, over time, it has come to mean so much more to me.

One of the most powerful parts of the song, for me, is the following part, as it reminds me of moments in my own life when I didn't want to say goodbye to someone I cared about. 

> One of these days, you'll miss your train, and come stay with me.
>
> (It's always say goodnight and go)
>
> We'll have drinks and talk about things, and any excuse to stay awake with you.
>
> And you'd sleep here, and I'd sleep there. But then the heating may be down again
>
> (At my convenience)
>
> We'd be good, we'd be great together

> Why'd you have to be so cute?
>
> It's impossible to ignore you, ah
>
> Why must you make me laugh so much?
>
> It's bad enough we get along so well

> Just say goodnight and go

The structure of the song is also something that makes it truly special. Unlike many pop songs that follow a predictable pattern, "goodnight n go" takes unexpected turns, keeping me engaged and intrigued throughout. The way it builds to that enchanting humming towards the end is pure magic. It's like a musical journey that leaves me feeling calm and at peace, no matter what I may be going through.

Ariana Grande's "Sweetener" album, and this song in particular, has been a constant source of comfort and solace in my life. "Sweetener" forms the foundation of my emotional well-being, and the ***sweetener philosophy*** is the kernel of my existentialist's heart.
