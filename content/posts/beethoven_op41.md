Beethoven has two adorable flute sonata. One is **Anh.4**, composed around his early 20. It was found amongst Beethoven's papers after his death, remaining unpublished until 1906 ([source wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute_Sonata_in_B-flat_major_(attributed_to_Beethoven))). Its *Largo* movement is absolutely gorgeous:

The other is Op. 41, composed when he was around 30. Vivid, bouncy and cute:

I was fascinated by these two pieces when first heard them in high school. While I later inevitably gradually become more found of other sophisticated works, they stayed as my loves â€” they're so adorable. Happy Sunday!
