Attending the admitted PhD open house at USC Marshall’s DSO department was an invaluable experience. It was a rare opportunity to engage with multiple faculty members. USC has a beautiful campus located in a delightful and convenient neighborhood.

One of the most interesting thing was when I tried to crowdsource representative attributes for a good PhD student by asking everyone the question: *What makes a popular job market candidate?* Their responses provided a well-rounded view of what it takes to stand out. Below are the key takeaways:

- **Master a particular domain.** Depth matters. Establishing expertise in a focused area is crucial.
- **Balance technical depth with impact.** Strong theoretical foundations should be complemented by practical implications.
- **Choose an important, contemporary, and fundamental problem.** Research should be disciplined, impactful, and meaningful.
- **Prioritize contribution depth in a paper over quantity.** Quality of contribution matters more than the number of publications.
- **Own the problem.** Demonstrate a deep understanding to a model/method and commitment to solving it fundamentally.
- **Start with an interesting problem.** Passion and curiosity drive impactful research.
- **Invest in Theory and Applied Research (3:1) ** Having both strengthens the publication portfolio.
- **The academic job market is unpredictable.** There is no fixed formula for success. Strong research is a given, but the process also involves positioning and advisor support.

In the end, cracking the PhD job market is like solving a non-convex black box optimization problem—there are personal, even unknown constraints, randomness, and no closed-form solution. But with depth, impact, and a bit of strategic maneuvering, we might just maximize our chances.

**Courtesy to everyone in Marshall DSO.** A truly well-organized and successful open house, showcasing an exceptionally supportive culture. One faculty member described it as “a **boutique** PhD program”—indeed. It's well-structured, with an excellent student body, super strong group of people, and great care and attention for the students, plus generous funding. And of course, LA is gorgeous!
