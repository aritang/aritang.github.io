The opening 45 seconds of this piece are like a fog-draped dream. The piano strikes raindrops of notes on a misty, ethereal dreamscape, like cobblestoned street under the soft glow of a solitary streetlamp.

Three years ago, this enchanting introduction to the Sonatine first shuffled into my playlist as I was lost in thought at the back of a bus, journeying through a tender rain and fog. Pahud's mastery of timbre of sophistication brings in quality as he always does, while Eric Le Sage's piano artfully renders the essence of a Parisian nocturne. It's as if one is meandering near an old abbey, the interplay of light and shadow reflecting the dance of thoughts and feelings, all set against the backdrop of a rain-soaked, dream-laden Paris at midnight.
