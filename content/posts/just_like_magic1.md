Here's a sneak peek into my latest work, sparked by an unexpected moment of inspiration. Days ago I was at the WINE conference, half-listening to a talk on fair division. The idea struck me suddenly, clear and compelling. I've since developed what I believe is an optimal mechanism â€“ one that promises a symmetric equilibrium and potentially lowers market prices in a buy-box market. It's not just effective, but also elegantly simple and, dare I say, quite charming in its design. Stay tuned for more details on this exciting development!
