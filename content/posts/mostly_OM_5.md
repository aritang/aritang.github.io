Takeaway: point of view of bridging practice and research.

### For industry solutions:

1. Need to consider a lot of details
2. Need to be fast and intepretation, therefore requires simple solutions
3. Don't care about theory.

### For academic works:

1. Need abstract to focus
2. Graced with time
3. Expect some generality, therefore theory.
