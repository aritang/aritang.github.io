Today The University of Chicago Symphony Orchestra performs our 2025 Halloween Concert. During the the William (*Guillaume*) Tell Overture by Gioachino Rossini, there's a lovely slow passage in the middle of the piece:

> This pastorale section in G major and in an A-B-A-Coda form, signifying the calm after the storm, begins with a *Ranz des vaches* or "Call to the Cows", featuring the cor anglais (English horn). **The English horn then plays in alternating phrases with the flute, culminating in a duet with the triangle accompanying them in the background.**
>
> This segment is often used in animated cartoons to signify daybreak or bucolic beauty, most notably in Walt Disney's *[The Old Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Mill)* and Marv Newland's *[Bambi Meets Godzilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi_Meets_Godzilla)*, which uses the tune as its main musical score before Godzilla stomps on Bambi.

Here's me playing it:

About 40 years later after Rossini's William Tell, the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg's incidental music to Henrik Ibsen's 1867 play *Peer Gynt*, also has a similar passage in "Morning Mood", where the flute and oboe take turns to sing a melody:
