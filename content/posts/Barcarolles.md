> Evoking the rush of water, the stroke of oars and the motion of the ocean, the Barcarolle was a folk song sung by Venetian gondoliers (the word comes from “Barca” meaning “boat”). Characterised by a rocking rhythm, suggestive of the movement of the gondola, a Barcarolle is usually of moderate tempo scored in compound time (often 6/8, 9/8 or 12/8). The genre has been used by many composers to great expressive effect.

Famous barcarolles:

- Jacques Offenbach's Barcarolle, from his Hoffman opera:

    And, like all good opera works, it comes with a famous melody adjusted for various arrangements

- Chopin's Barcarolle in F-sharp major, Op. 60. It's like the gondola here glides through a dream—not Venice, but a more metaphysical canal. It’s somewhat technically intimate but emotionally panoramic.

- Mendelssohn's "Venetian Boat Songs":

    > [Mendelssohn’s Songs Without Words](https://interlude.hk/lieder-ohne-wortecomposers-fancy-and-players-delight/) contain three Venetian Boat Songs or *Venezianisches Gondellied*, which display all the distinctive characteristics of the barcarolle, the most famous being Op 19b, No. 6 in G minor – a melancholic miniature which evokes Venice at night, enveloped by winter fog, bells tolling from a distant *campanile*. The other two (Op 30, No. 6 in F-sharp minor and Op 62, No 5 in A minor) are similarly haunting with their plaintive, lyrical melodies and restrained expressiveness.

- And of course lastly—Tchaikovsky's **"June"** piece from his set of twelve character pieces for solo piano called **"The Seasons, Op. 37a"**:

I like Tchaikovsky's Barcarolle best, somewhat. There's something about Tchai that makes him feel both **wounded and generous**. He never really repeats himself emotionally, or pleads to be understood. It's just all wonderful music and craftsmanship.
