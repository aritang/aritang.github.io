The Sticky Notes podcast had this wonderful episode about Mendelssohn's *A Midsummer Nights Dream*. It strikes the perfect balance: weaving together the composer‚Äôs background, the craft of his orchestration, and detailed comparisons of music passages. It‚Äôs the kind of introduction that makes the music both accessible and luminous:

Much has been said about Mendelssohn‚Äôs genius in creating the sound world of fairies. Later ballets and operas (*Giselle*, *Rusalka*, *The Nutcracker*) explored magical atmospheres, but Mendelssohn opened the door. This really pushes string sections to their limits. The quicksilver brilliance is actually quite technically demanding. Playing light pixie-dust music is much harder than Wagner shouting with 20 brass backing you up.

Yet what often goes unnoticed is another aspect of his genius: the way Mendelssohn composes **pride**‚Äîthe human grandeur, the nobility of presence. In the Overture around 1'10'', the fairy world suddenly yields to a celebratory march. It feels as though a royal procession strides into the enchanted forest, scattering pixie dust with its elegance and authority. It's not brash triumph but something more refined: a poised, confident pride, deeply connected to Mendelssohn‚Äôs upbringing in a family of immense wealth and cultural standing, where‚Äîas was said‚Äî‚Äúall of Europe came to their house.‚Äù

To my delight, the Sticky Note podcast also featured snippets from Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra‚Äôs 1994 Deutsche Grammophon recording‚Äîmy own favorite interpretation. The following video starts at 1'02'', with the best version, for a taste of the fairy-to-human transition:
