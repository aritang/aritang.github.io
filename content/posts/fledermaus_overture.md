The U of C Symphony Orchestra is rehearsing *Ouvertüre zur Fledermaus* for Halloween these days. I play piccolo for this piece. It saves a lot of practice time (piccolo can easily play fast). Though the piece sounds easy, the rubato of the piece takes a lot of rehearsals to align everyone on track.

Fledermaus overture is such a ubiquitous piece for all music festivals that it's yelling for parody. *Tom and Jerry* has one episode dedicated to it — doesn't the background look like the Schönbrunn Palace?
