Wow, it’s been a year already! -> Definition (cite)

When I hit "publish" on my first blog post, I had no idea where this journey would take me—yet here I am, 365 days later, with a digital archive full of musings, analyses, and more Ariana Grande references than I ever imagined.

It’s been a wild ride, one that’s taught me more than I could ever summarize in a single post, but I’m going to try anyway—because, well, that’s what bloggers do.

## A Symphony of Subjects

Over the past year, this blog has become a melting pot of ideas. From dissecting the labyrinthine world of digital advertising and cookies (no, not the chocolate chip kind) to exploring the delicate notes of Rachmaninoff’s compositions, the topics here have been as varied as a Spotify playlist on shuffle. Like one day I’m moaning over the complexities of antitrust laws, the next I’m raving about the latest ballet performance that took my breath away. It's been a delightful mix, proving that curiosity truly has no bounds—and neither does my ability to procrastinate on writing about it.

## Lessons Learned: the Good, the Bad, and the Podcast-Induced

This blog has been more than just a platform for sharing thought—it’s been a classroom, a stage, and sometimes, a therapist's couch.

I like digging into economic theories—it's surprisingly fun especially when you throw in a dash of humor and a pinch of sarcasm. A lot of the insights and ideas comes from podcast at breakfast—what a great way to start the day—except when it’s not, and I’m half-asleep, nodding along to economic jargon like a zombie who just wants some coffee. That's a lot of papers, news and articles read and re-think.

But the real lesson? Persistence. Whether it was pushing through a dense academic paper or forcing myself to decode the latest in algorithmic regulation, I’ve come to appreciate the grind. [write about waking up at midnight] It's not always glamorous, but hey, neither is life. And that’s okay, because the satisfaction of understanding something complex—or writing a killer blog post about it—makes it all worthwhile.
