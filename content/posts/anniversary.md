> ### A Journey Through Ideas, Insights, and the Occasional Podcast-Induced Breakfast Yawn

Wow, since [where we've started](/posts/definition), itâ€™s been a year already!

When I hit `return` after the very first `git push origin main`, launching the blog, I had no idea where this journey would take meâ€”yet here I am, 365 days later, with an archive full of musings, analyses, and more Ariana Grande and Rachmaninov references than I would have ever imagined.

Itâ€™s been a wild ride, one thatâ€™s taught me more than I could ever summarize in a single post. But Iâ€™m going to try anywayâ€”

## Favourite blogs:

Assumption zero for information economicsâ€”that there is a cost for acquiring information. In other words, don't expect anyone to screen through the archive for a post, and that providing high-quality recommendation itself is utmost invaluable. So here are three selected posts, my most favourite:

> **[blowing in th wind](/posts/blowing_in_the_wind/)** | about the ironman triathlonâ€”"delivery, courier and Didi driver".
>
> [**Google Gossip â€” the Cookies Confusion and the Antitrust Avalanche**](/posts/google_gossip/) | a look into Google's advertisement income landscape.
>
> [**nocturnal narratives**](/posts/midnight_musing/) | whispers from my nightstand shelf.

## A Symphony of Subjects

Over the past year, this blog has become a melting pot of ideas. Frankly, I found that I can be so easily distracted sometimes...

Music has been a constant theme, from [the emotive power of Rachmaninoff](/rachmaninoff_andante_cantabile/) to [the playful dissection of pop culture moments](/posts/said_so/). Technical posts range all the way from [the cookie series](/posts/cookie_series/) to [paper reading notes](/posts/selling_info/). Sometimes I cram the contents parallel with my projects, like [proofs for Whittle Index](/posts/whittle_index_technical/) or [SHERLOCKâ€”my AI-written code detector](/posts/all_about_sherlock/). And of course, commentsâ€”[lowercase aesthetic](/posts/lowercase_aesthetic/), [movie reviews](/posts/b_for_busy_n_sideways/), and [social issues](/posts/blowing_in_the_wind/).

It's been a delightful blend, proving that curiosity truly has no boundsâ€”and neither does my ability to procrastinate on writing about it.

## Lessons Learned: the Good, the Bad, and the Podcast-Induced

Maintaining the blog's daily updates wasn't entirely easy. It's a lot of reading and writing. A lot of the insights and ideas comes from breakfast reading feedsâ€”news and podcastsâ€”when I'm half-asleep, nodding along to economic jargons like a zombie who just wants some coffee; limit-time paper summary sessions can be really nice academic practices; cab rides soring in the neon  after concerts are absolutely the bed for ideas and insight.

Writing has been a deeply reflective, and Iâ€™ve learned so much along the way. One lesson that stands out is knowing when to hold back on top of obsessive persistence. Itâ€™s okay to push hard, but itâ€™s important to recognize when youâ€™re crossing into territory where the pursuit of excellence doesnâ€™t overshadow what we're looking for in the first place.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by. Glad we meet and, in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good nightðŸ’‹.
