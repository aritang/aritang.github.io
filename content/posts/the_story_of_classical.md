**The Story of Classical** ([Link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-story-of-classical/id1727191760)), produced by Apple Music Classical, is a nine-episode guide to classical music. Each episode is about an hour long and features insightful commentary along with extended excerpts of significant works.

Notably, it includes generous, lengthy samples (no copyright issues for the largest company in the world...) that don’t just capture the highlights of each piece—unlike many other classical music introductions. The series strikes an excellent balance between accessibility, depth, and professional quality.

It’s well worth the time as a morning refresher with a moderate mental load, like perfect as a backdrop for make-up sessions.

One general thinking, for classical music production, perhaps a benign monopoly works better...
