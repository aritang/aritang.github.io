As a member of the Mancity Official Supporter Club of Shanghai, I went to the club's match day banquet. The football gang gathered today to celebrate weekend.

Tonight (Nov. 25) features ManCity playing against Liverpool. Despite the final result is an 1-1 draw and the game was a bit boring cause Liverpool takes a conservative defensive strategy, the game's fun is next level because friends and fans gather together. The atmosphere is awesome in the club.
