A friend in Stanford recommended the 2nd moment of Mozart Symphony No.40 in G minor to me.

"It was a good waltz", he said. Well, it is arguably one of Mozart's most famous symphony pieces. Listen [here](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=6kbP-FDVaHY&si=ngUor9is1IUdaF9E&feature=xapp_share) for its infamous first movement *Molto allegro*.

But the second movement (listen [here](https://youtu.be/N1cexwLOvtY?si=VY2wSj7rNJSvXZyA&t=467)) is not necessarily the best dancable waltz. For waltz music that actually intended for dance, one should go for Tchaikovsky's ballet suites, they have the perfect tempo and momentum for dances. Mozart's commissioned work never really aligned with his jobsâ€“he always goes to far.

As for the two of us.
