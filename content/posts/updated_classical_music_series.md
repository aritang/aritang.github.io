I’d love to keep track of all the classical pieces and composers I’ve written about—whether from concert reflections or deep-dive listening sessions that make me curious about a piece’s background.

{{<figure align="center" src="/art/monet_winter_haystack.jpeg" caption="" width="100%">}}

Music taste is hard to align, but I hope this list offers a practical glimpse into mine. Maybe you’ll find some insight—or even a new favorite piece.

I usually prioritize academic posts over musical ones, but when things get hectic, I turn to music. So if you spot a flurry of music posts, that’s me in full-on busy mode. Anyway—here’s the list:
