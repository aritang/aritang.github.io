Recently I noticed a weirdly popular TikTok trend:

The original choreography is by 不齐舞团: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/IIVRm-sQkVo?si=eHaSvBGUov6LEFxs), based on a Chinese-Cantonese rap song:

Its rise to fame isn’t just algorithmic luck. The song taps into the mindset of a generation of young people in China today — caught in between. They’re not fully grounded in traditional culture, yet feel unable to move upward either. There's a great article that explores this cultural moment:
