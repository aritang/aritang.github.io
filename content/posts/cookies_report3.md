Wall Street Journal has its take on Google's dicey cookie policy. Let's wait for a while for the dust to fall:

> In a major reversal, Google is ending [a plan to eliminate cookies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-chrome-to-phase-out-third-party-cookies-in-effort-to-boost-privacy-11579026834?mod=article_inline) in its Chrome browser after four years of efforts, delays and disagreements with the advertising industry.

> The decision to keep the pervasive tracking technology known as “cookies” in Chrome comes after a series of setbacks, as both digital-advertising companies and regulators objected to the plan and to Google’s proposed replacement technologies.

> Privacy advocates hailed the move, but advertisers objected, saying that Google’s plan to replace cookies would force them to shift spending to the search giant’s digital-ad products.

I felt a bit sorry for Google. Whatever they do people are going to point fingers—when Cookies are permitted, people accused them of being a violation to privacy. When Google attempts to take down cookies, it's concerns for Google's market power. Either way it's their fault.
