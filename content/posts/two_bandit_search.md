An interesting paper recommended by Professor Kimon Drakopoulos:

> This paper studies a game of strategic experimentation with two-armed bandits whose risky arm might yield a payoﬀ only after some exponentially distributed random time. Because of free-riding, there is an ineﬃciently low level of experimentation in any equilibrium where the players use stationary Markovian strategies with posterior beliefs as the state variable. After characterizing the unique symmetric Markovian equilibrium of the game, which is in mixed strategies, we construct a variety of pure-strategy equilibria. There is no equilibrium where all players use simple cut-oﬀ strategies. Equilibria where players switch finitely often between the roles of experimenter and free-rider all lead to the same pattern of information acquisition; the eﬃciency of these equilibria depends on the way players share the burden of experimentation among them. In equilibria where players switch roles infinitely often, they can acquire an approximately eﬃcient amount of information, but the rate at which it is acquired still remains ineﬃcient; moreover, the expected payoﬀ of an experimenter exhibits the novel feature that it rises as players become more pessimistic. Finally, over the range of beliefs where players use both arms a positive fraction of the time, the symmetric equilibrium is dominated by any asymmetric one in terms of aggregate payoﬀs.

I'll read the math in detail and write about it later :)
