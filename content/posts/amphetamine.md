Amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants that are used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

### the drug's mechanism

ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is characterized by symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The key brain region associated with ADHD includes the 

- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Responsible for executive functions, such as attention, planning, decision-making, and impulse control.
- **Basal Ganglia:** Involved in the regulation of movement and reward processing.
- **Cingulate Cortex:** Plays a role in cognitive control and emotional regulation.

In ADHD, dopamine signaling is often less efficient, leading to difficulties in maintaining attention and controlling impulses. Amphetamines has multi-facetd functions that jointly boost dopamine availability in certain brain regions, inclusing:

1. **Promote Release:** They enter presynaptic neurons via DAT and NET and induce the release of dopamine and norepinephrine from synaptic vesicles.
2. **Reverse Transport:** They cause the transporters to reverse their direction, pumping more neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
3. **Inhibit MAO:** They inhibit monoamine oxidase, which breaks down dopamine and norepinephrine, further increasing their levels.

This combined actions lead to a significant increase in dopamine and norepinephrine availability in key brain regions, enhancing attention and reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity.

### the problem

The abuse of amphetamines, such as Adderall and Vyvanse, among undergraduates at elite universities has been a growing concern. These stimulants are often misused by students seeking to enhance their academic performance, particularly during exam periods. Some studies showing that up to **20%** of college students may misuse these drugs at some point during their academic careers.

The problem is that, although amphetamines are prescriptive drugs, ADHD diagnosis is carried out by emphirical questionnaires rather than blood testsâ€”which says, that students (and that they're clever in the first place) can almost read the syndrome list for ADHD, fake some ADHD syndrome, and get a prescription from the doctor and buy it at any drug stores.

The misuse of amphetamines is associated with risks including dependency (of course), cardiovascular issues (because the drug causes blood vessels to contract), and mental health problems such as anxiety and psychosis. And it doesn't make study efficient. Because the drug functions by making certain brain regions hyperactive, hence often the student taking amphetamines will have sleep issues. However, our brain process and form long-term memory mostly in deep sleeping phases. So whatever amphetamines-learnt, is bound to be forgot anyway.

Unless the student wishes to forget everything right after the exam in the first place.
