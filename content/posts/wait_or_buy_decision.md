See previous post for the idea: [My Ex, Apple PR, and the Economics of (Not) Buying an iPhone](/posts/persuading_consumer_to_buy_early/) — for iteratively updated products like iPhone, do consumers strategically decide on Wait-to-Buy?

It turns out that the market does anticipate upcoming product and update expectations w.r.t. new information. When Trump first announced the Tariff raise, Apple Pro Fans quickly reacts and adjusted their policy for iPhone Purchase:

> On April 5, a 10% “baseline” tariff will kick in on all imports into the United States. ... Imports from China, where Apple manufacturers the vast majority of iPhones and Macs, will be hit with a 54% tariff. Imports from India, which is responsible for 10-15% of iPhone assembly, will face a 27% tariff. Imports from Vietnam, where Apple makes various models of AirPods, iPad, and Apple Watch, will face a 46% tariff... The immediate possibility is that existing iPhones get more expensive in the coming weeks.

Usually the wait-and-buy strategy (without the Tariff surprise) is like

> In general, I advise people to buy an iPhone when they need one, regardless of what time of the year it is.

> This year, my advice is shaping up to be different. I think that if you think you’ll need a new iPhone anytime within the next six months, now is the time to buy. Sure, you might miss out on the bells and whistles of the new iPhone 17 coming this fall, but you’ll pay a lot less than someone buying an iPhone a few weeks from now.

> But based on what we know right now, here’s what to expect:
>
> 1. The iPhones sold today (iPhone 15, iPhone 16) will get more expensive sooner rather than later.
> 2. The iPhone 17 lineup coming later this fall will be more expensive. Waiting for the iPhone 17 might cost you a lot more than just new features.
>
> This advice also extends to the Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Realistically, the advice also applies to just about any product made by any company, but we focus on Apple here at 9to5Mac.
