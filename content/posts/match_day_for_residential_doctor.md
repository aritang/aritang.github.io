Match Day happens on the **third Friday in March** (March 21, 2025, in this year's case). On Monday of that week, students learn whether they've matched with a residency program but they don't yet find out where they have matched. This Match status notification is sent by email at 10am ET on Monday. (Students who do not match by Monday may apply for supplemental offers that concludes on Thursday, the day prior to Match Day.)

> In the United States, senior medical students (both MD and DO) applicants and residency programs that register with the NRMP participate in a process known as "the Match." Applicants for the NRMP Main Residency Match usually begin the application process in the summer, and programs review applications and invite selected candidates for interviews held between October and February. After the interview period is over, applicants submit to the NRMP a "rank-order list" of programs where they wish to train. Similarly, residency programs submit a rank order list of applicants they prefer to train. The process is blinded so that neither applicants nor programs see each other's rank order lists. Aggregate Match results can be found on the NRMP public website.
>
> The two parties' rank order lists are processed using the NRMP's matching algorithm, which creates [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) (a proxy for optimal) matches between applicants and programs.

The algorithm runs "applicant-proposing" ([The Matching Algorithm](https://www.nrmp.org/intro-to-the-match/how-matching-algorithm-works/)).
