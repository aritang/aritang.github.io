The art of internet archeology led me to [the distinguished lecture given by Sendhil Mullainathan, "***Economics in the Age of Algorithms***"](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2025/program/1444), at AEA Annual Meeting that took place in Hilton San Francisco Union Squareâ€”I've been there, several times! The talk took place Jan. 3, 2025. The video is available
