The courier job in China has long been regarded as a tough, low-paying, and insecure occupation. With limited benefits and high risks, it’s a job that many take on for part-time hours or as a side hustle. In our previous posts, we've touched on the struggles of delivery riders before: ***[Blowing in the wind](/posts/blowing_in_the_wind/)***—perhaps because I’m no stranger to ordering takeout and shopping online too often!

However, JD.com, one of China’s largest e-commerce giants, has recently announced a groundbreaking decision: starting March 1, 2025, they will provide **full social security benefits**—the complete “**five insurances and one fund**”—for its full-time food delivery riders.

> This decision marks a significant shift in the way the company treats its riders, providing them with a vital safety net and recognizing their contributions to the platform's success. For years, China's food delivery industry has grappled with issues of rider welfare, with many riders lacking access to **basic social security benefits, such as medical insurance and pension plans**.

For years, the food delivery industry in China has struggled with rider welfare issues, especially due to the reliance on freelance or outsourced workers who often lack any form of safety net. JD.com's new policy is seen as a major step forward for both the company and the industry at large. By offering **“five insurances and one fund”**, JD is not only improving its workers' welfare but also setting a new industry standard. This pioneering move is likely to inspire other companies in the sector to reconsider how they treat their delivery personnel, potentially fostering a healthier, more sustainable industry.

**JD.com's initiative signals a broader industry shift**, emphasizing the importance of worker well-being and encouraging other companies to follow suit. This could eventually contribute to a more comprehensive social security system in China, which recognizes the crucial role that food delivery workers play in the economy.
