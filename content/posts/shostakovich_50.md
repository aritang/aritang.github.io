In memory of one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, **Dmitri Shostakovich** (Sept. 25, 1906 — Aug. 9, 1975):

Shostakovich’s life reads like a legend. He seemed to live with his whole heart, navigating both artistic triumph and personal turbulence. His early breakthrough came with his *Symphony No. 1* (1925), written at just 19, which won acclaim in both Russia and the West. But in 1936, official criticism targeted his work — especially his successful opera *Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk* (1932). Under intense pressure, he withdrew his *Fourth Symphony* before its premiere, and composed *Symphony No. 5* (1937) as a public “response” that restored his standing. The piece satisfied official expectations, yet still carried a subtle undercurrent of irony.

Despite these ups and downs, Shostakovich remained deeply connected to his homeland. In 1941, during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the **Siege of Leningrad** became one of history’s most harrowing episodes. The city was surrounded for 872 days (September 1941 – January 1944), causing over a million deaths from starvation and bombardment.

It was during this time that Shostakovich began his *Symphony No. 7 in C major* — the “Leningrad” Symphony — inside the besieged city. Evacuated to Kuybyshev (now Samara), he completed it in December 1941. The work became a powerful artistic statement of resilience. Its most famous performance took place on August 9, 1942 in Leningrad itself. The city’s surviving musicians were gathered from wherever they could be found — some from military service — and given extra rations so they could endure rehearsals. The broadcast of the performance, relayed through loudspeakers across the city and toward enemy lines, was both a cultural event and a message: *Leningrad is still alive*.

Shostakovich’s career continued to reflect both artistic courage and careful navigation of official opinion. Works like *Symphony No. 13 “Babi Yar”* (1962) addressed sensitive you-know-what historical themes. Still, he received honors such as the Leningrad Medal, at times losing and later regaining recognition. When he died in 1975, he was remembered as a “great Soviet artist” and a figure whose music had touched audiences worldwide.

Once, Shostakovich scribbled a line on the back of a score: *“We shall meet again in Petersburg, as though we had buried the sun there.”* In the end, unlike some of his contemporaries who lived in exile, he remained in his homeland — though it was a long journey filled with both hardship and glory.

Russian music has a way of reaching into the deepest layers of the human soul. To be moved by such art — and by Shostakovich’s voice in particular — is to be reminded of what connects us, despite all our differences.
