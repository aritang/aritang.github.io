OMG, it's finally Friday! Tomorrow marks the launch premiere of a new Econ-CS lab, and we have some exciting talks lined up: Jianwei Huang from CHUK-SZ, Xiaolei Wu from FDU, and Jirong Wen from Renming University will be giving three engaging presentations.

I initially planned to attend a coffee festival in the morning, but given that they're offering complimentary coffee and snacks during the tea break, and with many of my friends, my advisor, and the entire ITCS community attending, it seems like a great idea. It's sure to be a cool experience.

Typically, when I attend an event, I evaluate its incremental benefits for me, factoring in the opportunity cost of my time. However, this time, I'm genuinely excited about the lab's kickoff, especially since my advisor is leading the way. It's truly remarkable. Goodnight and will update about the talks I hear tomorrow.
