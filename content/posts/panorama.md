Tchaikovsky’s *Sleeping Beauty* is one of the few works he was genuinely proud of — which is remarkable, considering his famously self-critic personality. The score is so stunningly good that, at times, the ballet choreography seems boring compared to the music.

{{<figure align="center" src="/art/tchai_smiling.jpeg" caption="Tchaikovsky was notorious for writing ballet music so difficult that dancers struggled to find tempo and balance on stage. (Of course, critics in 1890 hadn’t yet met Stravinsky’s *Rite of Spring* — that riot was still 40 years away.)" width="50%">}}

Some dancers call Sleeping Beauty a “classical gem in the repertoire, showing all the amazing techniques”. It does feel a bit long and uneventful,  but Tchaikovsky makes it forgivable.

For example, Act II sets the stage for a very *classic* fairy-tale trope: the prince goes hunting in the forest (cliché), gets lost (again?), and eventually stumbles upon the sleeping princess (predictable...) Before he reaches her, there’s an orchestral *Panorama* (much like an intermission), where the prince takes the Lilac fairy's boat for four straight minutes of hand-waving, in breathtakingly beautiful:

The music is *Panorama*, and frequently featured in Sleeping Beauty Suites (selections for pure orchestra performance)
