The G20 2024 took place Nov. 18 and 19 in Rio, Brazil. G20 for Group of Twenty, is a club of the worldâ€™s largest economies, representing about **85% of global GDP**, **75% of international trade**, and **two-thirds of the worldâ€™s population**. It started in **1999** as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, but it wasnâ€™t until the 2008 global financial crisis that it became a platform for world leaders to gather.

Fun fact: The G20 includes 19 countries and the EU, which, however, the 19 countries includes France and Germanyâ€”so there's a bit of trouble when taking sum of their GDPs. And it doesnâ€™t have a headquarters! The host country rotates every year, and with each new venue comes a fresh agenda:

Anyway. This year's G20 summit took place in Rio, Brazil. It highlight suffering in Gaza and Ukraine, urges cooperation on ***climate, development and immigration***. The summit reflects geopolitical tensions as Trump returns. And our President Xi has key role, offers support to "Global South". Here's the news:

> ## the Guardian: ***No-show Joe***: G20 leaders take group photo without Biden
>
> [Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden) headed for a photo with fellow [G20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20) leaders in Rio de Janeiro at his final summit as US president on Monday â€“ only to find they had already taken the picture without him.

"No-show Joe"? This is meanðŸ¤£. I think the blame is not on him:

> Biden and the Canadian prime minister, [Justin Trudeau](https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau), then came in from another direction, after a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit â€“ but it was too late and the other leaders had already dispersed.
>
> The Italian prime minister, [Giorgia Meloni](https://www.theguardian.com/world/giorgia-meloni), also missed the picture. She, Biden and Trudeau formed a separate huddle.

They made it up on the second day, for sure: ***[Take two: Biden makes it into G20 leadersâ€™ photo after missing first one](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/joe-biden-g20-leader-photo)***.
