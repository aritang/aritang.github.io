The first day of ISCOM has been fascinating. A talk that really impressed me is the Keynote tutorial of supply chain finance given by [Prof. Gangshu Chi](https://www.scu.edu/business/isa/faculty/cai/) from Michigan University. It's a new area in OM. Basically, supply chain finance is through financing up and down the supply chain, reallocate risks to more risk-duable and strong sectors so as to push forward the efficiency frontier. The idea is really novel and sounds an empty yet promising field to study. Another talk that have caught my attention is DRL for inventory management, given by [Prof. Peng](https://www.scu.edu/business/isa/faculty/cai/) from Peking University. His perspective on DRL for inventory system is impressive - despite I've followed his work for some time, hearing him giving a thought-provoking Keynote lecture in person is really impressive. Also, the Keynote lecture of [Saif Benjaafar](https://cse.umn.edu/isye/saif-benjaafar) about sharing economic is pretty comprehensive, we met at breakfast and he was really nice and cool.

Will write blogs about these three talks for sure. Especially Prof. Peng's series of work.

Btw, my tutor of research [Prof. Chaolin Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=tjZvp3gAAAAJ&hl=en) is head of organization comittee and [Prof. DD Ge](https://dblp.org/pid/41/3444.html) is chair. [Zizhuo Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangzizhuo/), whom my bestie has worked with, showed up as the host of a track. Friends are there as well. And our paper got second place in the data competition. Coolness.
