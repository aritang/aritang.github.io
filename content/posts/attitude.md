There are conflicts happening every now and then. The best way is just to focus on something else. Because if one just gets distracted by all those negative things, he might as well doesn't have anything more meaningful on his mind to do. It would be pathetic.

The attitude expressed by Ariana Grande's billboard interview (almost 9 years ago) pretty much reflected this pov:

> Grande’s determined to avoid any kind of controversy. She won’t comment, for example, on Swift’s Twitter scuffle with guest *Dangerous Woman* rapper [Nicki Minaj](https://www.billboard.com/artist/312259/nicki-minaj/chart) over the latter’s perceived 2015 MTV Video Music Awards snub: 
>
> “If people are fighting, I stay as far away as possible. I’ve said this a million times: I hate drama. I love women in the industry. I’m a big fan of all my peers, and I try to keep it a hundred. That’s why I don’t look at anything. I’m like, ‘My song’s out!’ Then I run for the hills. ‘Here’s another picture of my dogs! Bye!’ ”
