The term "Penn Faces" originates from the University of Pennsylvania. It refers to the phenomenon where students maintain a facade of happiness and success, even if they are struggling internally. This facade creates an impression that everyone around them is doing well, which can lead to feelings of isolation and inadequacy for those who are struggling but don't want to show it. The constant pressure to appear perfect exacerbates stress, anxiety, and depression.

On the other hand, "Duck Syndrome" is a term commonly used at Stanford University. It describes how students may appear to glide effortlessly through their academic and social lives (like a duck gliding smoothly on water), while underneath the surface, they are paddling frantically to keep up (just as a duck's legs are constantly moving underwater). This metaphor highlights the intense effort and stress that are often hidden from view, contributing to significant mental health challenges.

Students at elite universities face immense pressure to succeed academically, socially, and professionally. The competitive environment, high expectations, and fear of failure can lead to severe mental health issues, including but not limited to stress, anxiety, depression, isolation and imposter syndrome, etc.

Universities are taking actions, but the deeply ingrained culture of perfectionism and high achievement at these places are somewhat pertinent—it's easy to say but hard to actually achieve somehow a collective shift in attitudes towards mental health, emphasizing that it's okay to struggle and seek help, and that true success includes taking care of one's mental and emotional well-being.

Perhaps everyone should just go and watch ***Inside Out 2***... It's the cheapest and effective therapy—and served with popcorn!
