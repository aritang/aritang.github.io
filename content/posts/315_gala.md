March 15th is World Consumer Rights Day—to raise global awareness about consumer rights and needs, and to demand respect and protection for all consumers. 

In China, the day is marked by a two-hour prime-time show on state-run China Central Television (CCTV), where brands are publicly criticized for issues like poor-quality products, robocalls, and illegal collection of personal information. Reporters often would spend months or even years under disguise in those problematic industries to finally unveil the truth on this day.
