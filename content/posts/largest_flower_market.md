The modern flower auction began in **the Netherlands in the early 1900s**. Specifically, in Aalsmeer, now home to the world’s largest flower market.

Before that, flower growers sold fresh-cut flowers directly to wholesalers or middlemen. Prices were opaque and growers had weak bargaining power. On top of that, flowers are highly perishable.

- A large clock starts at a high price.
- The price ticks down rapidly.
