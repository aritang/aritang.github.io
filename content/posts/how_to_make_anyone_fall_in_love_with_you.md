Masterpiece!!!

Some lucky people might be a 'natural' at being charismatic, got it from their healthy family. Though the most of us pick up our charm over time, by building intuition, 'gets it', or simply mimicing others. The book is brilliant because it systematically break down those intuition and tricks into solid, structued, scientific (at least, explainable) mechanisms.

This is love potion. And as the book ends with a best wishes "愿有情人终成眷属"
