draft: false
summary: Blackpink really do have nice resources. Their live version's backup vocal though, is a little bit too loud.

I recently stumbled on a BLACKPINK's single ***Tally***. It's a lightweight and melodic cute song. One lyric (out of Lisa's rap) especially captured me:

> Take apart the do's and don's, and lose the won's I'm getting mine.
>
> **Mines is mine. Yours is mine. This is mine. Get in line!**
