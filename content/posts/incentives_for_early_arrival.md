A serie of works about incentives for early arrival:

> Ge, Yaoxin, et al. "Incentives for Early Arrival in Cooperative Games." *Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems*. 2024.

> Zhang, Junyu, et al. "Incentives for Early Arrival in Cost Sharing." *Proceedings of the 24rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems*. 2025.

The gem is because the problem is taken **online**. I'm surprised that algorithmic game theorists took the problem first before economists. It's an interesting and exciting line of work and I look forward to its follow-ups.
