The official performance of 7 selected songs from Ariana Grande's 7th album **eternal sunshine** is out. They are:

> intro (end of the world)
>
> don't wanna break up again
>
> eternal sunshine
>
> supernatural
>
> yes, and?
>
> we can't be friends
>
> imperfect for you

My favourite is ***supernatural***, Ari's vocal is accurate and almost flawless:

Editor Katia Temkin seems to be in favor of her weird hand-held camera angle that moves back and forth in an annoyingly unstable way. Editing is also clueless. It's very disappointing to see this level of unprofessionalism in industry production. 

Hopefully it's not artistic choice though... PEACE✌️
