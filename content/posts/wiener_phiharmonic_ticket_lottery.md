The Wiener Philharmonic's New Year Concert is undoubtedly popular. Though most concerts' selling mechanism is first-come-first-served, Weiner Philharmonic runs a lottery to distribute the tickets:

> Due to extremely high demand, tickets for the three traditional end of year concerts of the Vienna Philharmonic are drawn by lot exclusively on the Vienna Philharmonic website. In this way, music lovers from all over the world have an equal chance to purchase these highly desired tickets. Between February 1 and 28, 2025, applications will be accepted to take part in the drawing for tickets to the end of year concerts 2025/26.

Note: concert tickets are priced as several levels—for this, ranging between 20€ to 1200€. The draw mechanism for the Wiener Philharmonic is:

> ### [For how many New Year's Concert tickets may I apply?](https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/neujahrskonzert/faq/general-questions-about-the-drawing-and-ticket-requests/5/#for-how-many-new-years-concert-tickets-may-i-apply)
>
> You can make one application for each of the three concerts. For the New Year's Concert you can apply for up to two tickets. For the New Year's Eve Concert and the Preview Performance you can apply for up to four tickets.
>
> ### [What is the procedure used for the drawing?](https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/neujahrskonzert/faq/general-questions-about-the-drawing-and-ticket-requests/5/#what-is-the-procedure-used-for-the-drawing)
>
> The drawing takes place completely anonymously through a computer program which randomly selects applicants from among all applications which have been submitted for the seats in each category which have been released for drawing. The tickets are then reserved for these applicants directly in our ticket reservation system. Every year, the chances of winning are the same for all participants.

And some details into the design of the mechanism:

> ### [If I choose a particular category and this is booked out, will I then be given tickets in a lower or higher category?](https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/neujahrskonzert/faq/available-categories-and-number-of-seats/4/#if-i-choose-a-particular-category-and-this-is-booked-out-will-i-then-be-given-tickets-in-a-lower-or-higher-category)
>
> No, this is not possible for technical reasons. Since the exact number of available seats are distributed through the drawing, the concert hall is filled at the end of the drawing. For this reason no alternatives can be offered.
>
> ### [In previous years it was possible to choose the option "any seat, any price". Now I do not find this option.](https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/neujahrskonzert/faq/available-categories-and-number-of-seats/4/#in-previous-years-it-was-possible-to-choose-the-option-any-seat-any-price-now-i-do-not-find-this-option)
>
> For administrative reasons we no longer offer this option.
>
> ### [What category should I choose to give me the best chances of being selected for tickets?](https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/neujahrskonzert/faq/available-categories-and-number-of-seats/4/#what-category-should-i-choose-to-give-me-the-best-chances-of-being-selected-for-tickets)
>
> Please understand that we cannot provide any information about chances in the respective categories. This depends on the number of applications, which is not possible for us to know in advance.

And the most popular New Year Concert's tickets, are not transferable:

> ### [What does “personalization” mean?](https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/neujahrskonzert/faq/personalization-of-tickets/14/#what-does-personalization-mean)
>
> The name of the respective concert visitor must be printed on every concert ticket. When entering the Musikverein building, the ticket must be presented together with an ID/passport - these must also be presented at any time if requested by the police. The names printed on the concert ticket and the ID must match!
