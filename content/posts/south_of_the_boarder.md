Summer is on the way! At least for us here in Shanghai. A few days ago, I stumbled upon "South of the Border" – a collaboration between Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello, and Cardi B – and it's been stuck in my head ever since.

The song exudes the typical Ed Sheeran bar-dance-music vibe, but with a twist. Camila adds a dash of Cuban flavor, while Cardi B brings her characteristic playfulness to the mix. Somehow, this combination sparks a chemistry that bridges their distinct genres seamlessly.

Honestly, Camila and Ed's voices blend together beautifully, recall "Bam Bam". It seems they're destined to keep producing dance floor hits as long as they continue to collaborate.

One more thing that caught my attention: every time Camila features in a song, the music video feels like a mini-movie. It's refreshing to see artists creating a narrative for their songs, rather than just lip-syncing into the camera for four minutes straight:

> You gotta love when artists actually make a story out of the song instead of just lip syncing into the camera for 4 minutes straight.
