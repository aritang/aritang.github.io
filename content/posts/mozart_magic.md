My advisor once told me what makes *Così fan tutte* so special and his favourite, is Mozart's quiet masterpiece of tolerance. Mozart doesn’t judge anyone for being ridiculous or impulsive or foolish or fickle. He just observes—with a kind of tolerant wit—and turns the whole thing into music that smiles at human nature instead of scolding it.

OK, so he'll probably forgive me for [being at the Cosi fan tutte's LA opera](/posts/cosi_fan_tutte/) premier but drank just enogh wine just to sleep through the 2nd act...

He also pointed me to Gieseking’s recording of *Sonata Facile*, which feels almost plain at first—simple lines, no drama and poured over emotions—but somehow it’s still perfect. Like it’s not trying to impress anyone, beautifully. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

Also, if you're feeling bad about putting things off today, remember:
