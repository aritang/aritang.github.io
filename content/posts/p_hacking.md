At the *Conference on Frontiers in Machine Learning and Economics* (2025), Professor Tamara Broderick from MIT gave a brilliant keynote, based on the paper *[An Automatic Finite-Sample Robustness Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14999)*. It's a metric that measures how sensitive are conclusions to the removal of just a small fraction of data?

## Motivation  

Even dropping a vanishingly small proportion of observations can matter.  
We should worry if removing a fraction $\alpha \in (0,1)$ of the data:  

- flips the sign of an estimated effect,
- alters statistical significance, or  
- reverses substantive conclusions.  

Formally, define the **Maximum Influence Perturbation (MIP)**: the largest change in an analysis outcome when at most $\alpha$ fraction of the data is removed.

## Methodology Setup  

The challenge is clear: brute-force exploration of all subsets feels NP-hard like obvious. So, approximation algorithms:

1. We frame estimation as minimizing empirical loss with optional penalty:  

   $$
   \hat{\theta}(w) = \arg\min_\theta \sum_{n=1}^N w_n f(\theta, d_n) + R(\theta),
   $$

   where $w \in \{0,1\}^N$ encodes which data points are included.  

2. Define a quantity of interest, e.g. a coefficient $\phi(\hat{\theta}(w))$.  

3. Apply a **first-order Taylor expansion** around the full-data solution $w = 1_N$:  

   $$
   \phi(w) \approx \phi(1) + \sum_{n=1}^N (w_n - 1)\,\psi_n,
   $$

   with influence score  

   $$
   \psi_n := \frac{\partial \phi(w)}{\partial w_n}\Bigg|_{w=1}.
   $$

This yields a **linear influence approximation**.  
Computation reduces to evaluating $\psi_n$, which is automatable with autodiff and implicit function theorems.  

A greedy-style selection over these influence scores provides a practical approximation to the Most Influential Set.

## Example: Microcredit RCTs  

Case study: Angelucci et al. (2015), 16,560 households in randomized controlled trials on microcredit.  

- **Original regression result:**  
  $$
  \hat{\theta}_1 = -4.55 \ \text{USD PPP/2 weeks}, \quad \text{std. err.} = 5.88.
  $$

- **Robustness analysis:**  
  - Dropping **one household** flips the sign (negative â†’ positive).  
  - Dropping **15 households** yields:  
    $$
    \hat{\theta}_1 = 7.03, \quad \text{std. err.} = 2.55.
    $$

Even in large, carefully designed experiments, results can be extremely fragile.

I think the paper's contribution lies in methodology: using linear influence approximations to make finite-sample robustness measurable and practical. In other words, if the conclusions hinge on a handful of data points, results are not necessarily robust.
