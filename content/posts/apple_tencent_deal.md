More drama! Recently, Apple and Tencent reached a deal: **WeChat Mini-Programs on iOS must now pay a unified 15% “Apple tax” on virtual goods**.

Basically, Apple gains a 30% commission rate for digital good sold on its ios platform (15% for <1-million business). In China, more than 92% people use WeChat. WeChat is not only a chat app but essentially a mega app where you can do EVERYTHING in it because of its *mini program* design — merchants can built their app API within WeChat and user (used to be able to) access service — and **pay** — indirectly using WeChat pay hence bypassing the Apple Commission.

FYI, according to 2024H1 China Video Game Industry Report, WeChat Mini-Program Games income is 16600000000RMB (2.3 billion usd). If I'm Apple, I'm gonna be unhappy cause these money could have gone through official App Store purchase and yield me at least 15% of 2.3billion revenue.

After prolonged bargaining, Tencent and Apple (seems to) strike a deal lately. Apple announce in its *[Mini Apps Partner Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/)* that now, Apple officially allow apps to host mini apps and they're supported Apple's Official [In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/), and Apple charge a 15% commission on them too.

Now you tell me, what it is — Co____tion?
