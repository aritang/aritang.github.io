Take Five is a jazz standard (i.e. a jazz song that has a rich history of being interpreted and reinterpreted), first recorded in 1959 and is the third track on [*Time Out*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_(album)) by the [Dave Brubeck Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brubeck#Dave_Brubeck_Quartet). The song is in quintuple $5/4$ time, and this is where it got its name.

Channeling my inner Dave Brubeck with a 'Take Five' moment, I am taking a short five-day breather to recharge and find some fresh tunes. Can't wait to jazz things up again with you all soon!

Love, ariana.
