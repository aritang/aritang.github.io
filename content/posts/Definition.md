We dream in summer.

![green_corridor](/definition/green_corridor.jpeg)

During the summer of 2023, I visited Stanford University and was very fortunate to meet several brilliant human beings who undoubtedly influenced me so much that in certain way, changed my life. 

One of them is Alvin Roth. 

Being a fan of Al Roth early on through a podcast, I bombarded him with emails the moment I arrived at Stanford - and the amazing Nobel laureate replied. He kindly invited this outrageously nasty kiddo to various academic activities throughout the summer. I was deeply impacted by this experience and am genuinely grateful for the opportunity to meet and converse with so many inspiring people with whom we share a mutual research intersections.

Al Roth has a blog - the market design blog - where incredibly intriguing, modern viewpoints are updated EVERYDAY. Well, if he (who is probably a hundred times busier than me) can do it, I can do it. As my ideas and stories are interestingly beautiful in some way, they're worth having a place to exist.

In memory of the midsummer night's dream of 2023, welcome to *ariana's blog*.
