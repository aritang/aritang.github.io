## starting today, losing weight w.r.t. A-share

[Quick shot of the original post on Sep. 10, 2024.](/files/weight_loss_a_share_archive.pdf)

A-share (Aè‚¡) is short for domestic shares in China that are traded mainly in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The owner of the post declared a 'contract' with the underlying asset being her own investment portfolio, that binds with her diet:

> When A-share is red (up), I eat dinner; when it's green (down), I skip it. Let's see which happens first: making money or losing weight.

(In Chinese context, red is lucky color for good hence when the stock going up it's red, contrasting to western notations)

She updates her post everyday with her return and dinner picture (or null with an empty hand, more or less often). Tens of thousands of netizens joins in to watch, tease and shares with her the experience.

**She starts on Aug. 5 weighing 54kg. Til Aug. 19 she only had three dinners and weighs 52kg. Til Sep. 7 she weighs 50.75kg.**

> Thanks to A-share, I achieved my weight loss goal that I had been struggling with for two years.
