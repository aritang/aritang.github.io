I was surprised to discover a lovely — and fairly well-loved — harp-flute duet that had somehow escaped my notice: *The Fog is Lifting*, Op. 41, by **Carl Nielsen**.

It’s always a joy to stumble across a hidden gem in the repertoire. This piece isn’t about flashy technique or dense chromatic harmonies. What it *does* offer is space — space for the performers to shape tone, color, and atmosphere. It’s all about **timbre**.

Talking about timber, for flute, you can’t go wrong with Emmanuel Pahud:

There’s also a version by Sir James Galway. I’ve never been especially drawn to his lighter, thin, more airy tone, but it’s worth remembering that recorded sound is only part of the picture. Acoustic space, evolving taste, even personal mood — all these play a role. I’ve learned to approach different interpretations with more openness, less judgment. Plus it’s Galway — as a flutist myself, I could use ten more years of practice before I start judging him…
