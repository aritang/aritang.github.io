I remember once going on a date when my friend casually said, *“I love opera. Someday, I want to go to London and watch **The Phantom of the Opera** live.”* 
At that moment, I was honestly terrified — what an ignorant, pretentious idiot?!

But then… I stumbled across a live concert by **The 3 Tenors** — Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, and Luciano Pavarotti — accompanied by the **Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra**, conducted by the legendary **Zubin Mehta**.  They performed Andrew Lloyd Webber’s *All I Ask of You* from *The Phantom of the Opera*.

Well, it felt less like “Phantom” and more like “the Shining Boss of the Opera”…

The OG was sung by Sarah Brightman in the 1986 London cast — and yes, it’s a **musical**, not an opera!

There’s something about this song that feels so tender and vulnerable. If anyone ever sang these words to me, I think I would fall in love on the spot...

And here’s the official recording of the master’s version by the three shining tenor boss of the opera: (it won't necessarily make you fall in love with the singer, but will probably make you fall in love with opera)
