"[Brainiac Maniac](https://youtu.be/mzL8GugPslM?si=mti7yajRuO9G-t4B)" is a track from the Plants vs. Zombies soundtrack. It's the background music of the final boss level -  the roof battle against Dr. Zomboss. The frenzy and messy cloud of synthesizers are pretty much the state that I'm pushing myself to be in right now - a little bit more stress to push productivity.

As a reference from Ariana Grande's single ***just like magic***, which is the top listen of my '23 music playlist:

> Wake up in my bed I just wanna have a good day,
>
> Think it in my head then it happens how it should, ayy.
>
> Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting. Then a meditation at like one thirty.
>
> Then I ride to the studio, listenin' to some shit I wrote.
