I am at Chicago Booth's PhD admits visit day.

Professor Budish suggested a really useful advice in terms of how to choose where to go to "Go and read (thoroughly) the papers of the professors you want to work with at all places you want to go to. Then you'll know." Professor Pernoud gave a hint on being successful PhD student: don't procrastinate, submit papers asap.

And I ran into Emir Kamenica in the hallway. Isn't that cool.
