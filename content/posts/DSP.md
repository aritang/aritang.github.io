The AdTech ecosystem is rich, complex, and difficult to navigate. Demand-side platforms (DSPs), unless they are hidden behind another layer like Agency Trading Desks, act as intermediaries between advertisers and ad exchanges. They function similarly to the relationship between a stock exchange, consumers, and securities.

DSPs depend heavily on third-party cookies. Through the process of *cookie syncing*, cookies and all privacy information are ultimately collected by DSPs. They use this data to segment consumers and sell these segments to advertisers, in addition to providing other services such as data management, analytic services, and insights.

Here are two stories about DSPs:

This article analyzes the top 10 DSPs from an advertiser's perspective. To start:

> ## Criteria for Evaluating DSPs
>
> ### Inventory and reach
>
> A DSP should support various creative assets, such as display, video, [CTV](https://setupad.com/blog/ctv-monetization/), and native ads, and optimize them with responsive and adaptive creatives across different screens. 
>
> It’s also essential for the DSP to reach the right target audience and support your first-party data. Look for advanced targeting options such as demographic, geographic, behavioral, contextual, and predictive targeting to ensure that ads reach the right person at the right time.
>
> ### Targeting capabilities
>
> Since picking the right target audience is one of the core functions of a DSP, DSPs should offer robust audience segmentation and targeting features. 
>
> A good DSP should enable filtering based on contextual attributes and insights, such as previous user interactions and behavioral points. The more audience filter options available, the better the DSP can select the most suitable audience for each campaign.
>
> ### Data integration
>
> Seamless integration with existing ad server data, DMPs, customer data platforms, and other relevant partners and platforms is necessary. This allows for effectively utilizing various data sources, enhancing campaign optimization and retargeting efforts.
>
> ### User interface and ease of use
>
> Given the complexity of adtech platforms, a DSP should offer a simple and intuitive user interface. This will help teams with limited programmatic advertising knowledge implement successful ad campaigns more easily.
>
> ### Reporting and analytics
>
> Effective DSPs provide comprehensive data analytics and insights, allowing users to track KPIs like ROAS, conversion rates, and [CTRs](https://setupad.com/blog/8-ways-to-increase-organic-ctr/). Look for real-time reporting and dashboards, which are important for clearly displaying campaign performance.
>
> ### Customer support and service
>
> Strong customer support is vital for maximizing a DSP’s benefits. Look for DSPs with robust training resources, detailed documentation, and reliable customer service. 
>
> **Note**: some DSPs only provide dedicated account management support during onboarding to ensure a smooth transition and effective platform use.

> ## Ad execs sound off on Amazon’s DSP dilemma
>
> By [Ronan Shields](https://digiday.com/author/ronandigiday-com/) and [Seb Joseph](https://digiday.com/author/seb-joseph/) • March 25, 2024

Amazon is striving to attract more advertisers to its platform. However, with major competitors like Google and *The Trade Desk* offering superior services, advertisers remain hesitant.

> Just 5% of the 44 respondents in a survey by Digiday chose Amazon as their preferred DSP if they could only select one. In contrast, nearly four in 10 (39%) opted for Google’s DV360. The same goes for The Trade Desk.

{{<figure align="center" src="/google_ad_gossip/dsp_simple_market_share.jpeg" caption="source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1475413/dsp-use/)" >}}

It's important to note that Amazon's DSP provides exclusive access to its consumers on the `Amazon` platform. However, advertisers also utilize Amazon for targeting audiences outside the Amazon network.

But what do advertisers truly desire?

> When asked to rank those needs, respondents to Digiday’s survey prioritized audience targeting capabilities first, followed by return on investment and return on ad spend, post-ad campaign insights and recommendations, technology vision and roadmap, and finally, data protection.

And here's survey data reflecting **part** of their market influence:

> A third of them (33%) said they’ve used the Amazon DSP in the past 12 months. Only The Trade Desk (at 56%) and Google DV360 (64%) received higher shares of responses.
