When working with wide DataFrames, pandas hides columns by default—really? This simple line ensures every column stands proudly in your console:

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)  # Show all columns
```

Default slicing of data really drives people crazy. To solve this, one usually has to switch to VSCode or other graphic-based ipynb consoles for better visuals. But even in termainl, the full DataFrame view is just one setting away.

Now my columns finally come out of hiding. Goodnight... Sleep tight, no ellipses in sight :)
