Here are three immensely useful tips my advisors gave me:

### Word Upperbound per Slide

Aim for no more than three bullet points per slide, with six words per point.

This isn’t a strict rule, but it’s a great standard and minimalistic ethos to follow whenever possible.

### Structure: Readability + Math

This is a more advanced technique, but incredibly helpful for theoretical econ talks.

Try to layer your slides with two different levels of information. The top level should be understandable by a general academic audience—even those outside your field. The logic should be coherent and accessible.

Then, by adding math symbols or brief technical cues, you create a second layer that experts can engage with—if they’re interested and cognitively available in the moment.

### The Pyramid of a Theory Talk

This is a key decision point when preparing your talk: *Should I include technical details from my proof?*

Think of your talk as a pyramid of understanding:

- **Ground floor:** Motivation and background
- **Level 1:** The model
- **Level 2:** Main results and takeaways
- **Top:** Technical details

You can only bring the audience to the next level if you've successfully brought them through the previous one. So plan accordingly. If you won’t have time to clearly explain the model or the main results, don’t bother with technical proofs. Focus your energy where it matters most.
