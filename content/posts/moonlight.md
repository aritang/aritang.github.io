Today is YuanXiao Festival, the first full moon of the year of the Dragon.

> "I saw the moonlight today. What reason should I make up so as to bring it to you?"

It reminded me of [Moonlight](https://youtu.be/denGNWMNsSY?si=iNxM1PMFdy1sHoYZ) by Ariana Grande from her third album Dangerous Woman. It's just an elegant, gorgeous love ballad. According to [Ariana Grande's Wiki](https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Moonlight#Background_and_recording):

> [Victoria Monét](https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Monét) (Grande's producer-slash-bestie) said "['Moonlight',] that’s what [Ricky](https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Ricky_Alvarez) [Alvarez, Grande's boyfriend then] called her one night. I think it was after their first kiss. He waited to kiss her for a long time, and she was really impressed. He’s such a gentleman, and the song is a great little bookmark of the start of their relationship."

Fun fact, the song only took three days to work on, Grande started work on this song on April 9, 2015, at 4 A.M., with [Victoria Monét](https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Monét) and [Tommy Brown](https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Tommy_Brown) in a spontaneous, midnight recording session.

> Grande sends Monet texts or voice memos when anything song-worthy happens to her, and the two write music during sleepovers in which they wear onesies and play the card game Bullshit.

But it was supposed to be but then replaced by Dangerous Woman to be the album title track. It was a pity that people stop doing this kind of music, that beautifully expresses pure emotion of love, anymore.
