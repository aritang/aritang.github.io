summary: It's a too quick an unravel market with four programs having exams on the exact same time, followed by exploding offers. But this is how I got in - Mi familia académica!

The 2023-24 school year is about to begin. Two years ago, I was the rookie, but now I’m anticipating those rookies - it is simply so much fun watching those freshmen undergrads unavoidably repeat every mistake and stupid decision I’ve made. Welcome!

And, it’s about time when the pilot class programs recruit among the undergraduate freshmen.

In my home university, departments (i.e. School of Finance, School of Economics) hold their own pilot class programs, respectively (with fancy names like “Financial Technology Elite Program” or “Interdisciplinary Science Pilot Class.”). Compared to normal undergraduate programs, these pilot class programs offer smaller classes, more modern and advanced course designs, and most importantly, more comprehensive and early academic exposure. The university expects those students to undergo adequate academic training and rise up as new stars in academia or industry. In general, each individual program is about 20-40 students, and it indeed aggregates a more intelligently inclined crowd and provides more resources for them.

But the admission process, in my point of view, is a bit of a rush and, in fact, pretty unfriendly and inefficient. Here’s the bigger picture: there are a total of five pilot class programs held by five different departments recruiting simultaneously right now (in early September, several days before the term starts). The departments hold full execution rights and, of course, operate in a decentralized manner. The information about these programs is published online over August. Before September, freshmen undergrads can sign up for the application of these programs via filling and submitting an application table. Then they would be admitted based on a comprehensive evaluation of the following three criteria: (listed in time order)

> - the score of the English Level Assessment Exam - a mandatory exam held by the university where **all** students take and obtain a score.
>
> - a math exam designed by the departments in charge - students would apply up for a program then take it.
> - an interview with the program’s committee - also, for students who apply for programs.

The math exam is the most critical of the three. To explain, first of all, the math exam weighs the most - about 40-80% of the overall ranking score calculated. Second, the score of the math exam is released before the interview, so it poses a prior belief of the student in the subsequent interview. Third, the English Level Assessment Exam is far less competitive and indifferentiable, hence almost useless. Therefore, in summary, whoever wants to enter the program needs to take the math exam and do it well.

Interestingly, four of the five pilot class programs scheduled their math exams at exactly the same time on the same day. Quite a coincidence... or is it?

Wait, the story isn’t over yet. Currently, as a member of one of the pilot class programs, I have to share a bit more about the admission offering that follows. After the math exam and the interview, on the night before the term starts, I received a phone call from the program’s committee, informing me that I had been accepted - precisely when I was having dinner with my family. It was a bit of a surprise and a shock because enrolling in a program means waiving one’s original major and getting transferred to a new trajectory. It’s a crossroad of life. But the people on the phone were so impatient. As I tried to say, “Yeah sure sorry but can I get back to you a little later…” a man on the other side of the call yelled in the background, “Take it or leave it, now!” They were insistent on an immediate answer. The situation was intimidating.

For me, I got in with almost no hesitation because my parents forced me to study economics, but I hated it and wanted to escape - so I took my chance - and now I’m doing market design, behavioral economics, and game theory… But after all the choice was tough in general, for a young, 18-year-old college freshman to decide his/her future in less than a minute.

In summary, the pilot class admission market is where similar programs operate exams at the same time, followed by exploding offers for a life-time decision. It kinda reminds me of the early medical residency market mentioned in Al Roth’s brilliant book “Who Gets What and Why” - insecure departments (hospitals) and students, quick-unraveling and explodarding offers. There’s a lot of room for coordination and improvement for sure. Perhaps, by coordinating every program’s exam to make it feasible for students to participate in multiple programs’ exams, and running a joint deferred-acceptance afterward with all the programs and students, the pilot class program admission market would be thicker, information would be more transparent, and it would be much easier a time for students and the committees.

BUT - I’m grateful for the program that admitted me and introduced me to my current field of research. The man who yelled on the other side of the phone for the exploding offer is now my favorite professor. **Mi familia académica!** And, I love economics and computer science now, honestly.
