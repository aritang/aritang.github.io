The films "B for Busy" (爱情神话) (2021) and "Sideways" (2004) share striking similarities that go beyond their surface narratives.

At their heart, both movies delve into the nuanced journey of relationships, weaving tales where characters meet, bond, fall in love, or drift apart. One man’s vacation can morph into another’s pivotal life journey or ending. As the stories unfold, some characters evolve, others remain unchanged but ready to move on, or, story put on holds, as friendships peaked as people continue their lives elsewhere.

A notable charm of these romantic comedies is their portrayal of mature relationships, which eschew the awkwardness and emotional tumult typical of younger love. Instead, these relationships unfold naturally and smoothly, like to a finely aged wine. Especially, the characters in both films embody an ideally elusive emotional experience that resonates deeply with those of us yearning for connection. Here are two scenes that sparkle the light of these two movies:

### Gloria's manifestation of 'husband-missing'

> I'm rich and free, with my husband missing. You can't ask for a better life.

Both films share a delightful quirk: they’re drenched in the vibrant landscapes where their stories unfold. In Sideways, it is California's loud and proud car culture—the Chevy that cruising down freeways flanked by lush vineyards and remote mountains. As in B for Busy's Shanghai, it is the humid air that buzzes with finesse, pretentious individualism, and a sprinkle of modern feminity, all set against a backdrop of mixed Shanghainese-Mandarin dialect. 

These are not just "where the story take place", they bring depth and resonance to the narratives. It captivates us but also crafts the perfect stage for the characters' emotions and adventures to come alive.
