Let’s take a musical detour. Ariana Grande’s “No Tears Left to Cry” isn’t just a pop hit; it’s a message of healing and care, mirroring the core of her album *Sweetener*. Directed by Dave Meyers, one of the industry’s top music video directors, the song’s visuals are as uplifting as its lyrics. So, as Ariana says, "pickin' it up"—join me in a brief musical escape from the daily grind of books, papers, and assignments, and keep writing...

btw, I highly recommend take a headphone, and watch the music video—it's availble [here](https://youtu.be/ffxKSjUwKdU?si=WNMrYsh_cDjKBW28).
