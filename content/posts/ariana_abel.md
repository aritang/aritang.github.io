I've always been trying to understand Ariana Grande, her music, lyrics, and interviews. Seeking a piece of her philosophy. Yet her artistic choices baffle with inconsistency, lacking a clear cohesive logic. She intentionally obscures, distorts motif, and leaves gaps.

I've immersed myself in her interviews and music, even the unreleased demos, piecing together her puzzle. Tonight, a new fragment from The Weeknd's single "Escape from LA" from album After Hours adds to it.

> You pillow talk to me about the men who try to get in between us.
>
> They buy you bags and jewelry, yeah.
>
> They think your kindness is so weak.
>
> No you don't give it up so easy, baby.

Abel's "After Hours" era overlapped with Ariana Grande's "Positions" (album) era, resulting in two song collaborations: "off the table" and "Save Your Tears." But Ariana Grande got married during this period so some of the lyrics doesn't fall into place. In off the table:

> [Weeknd's verse] 
>
> I'll wait for you,
>
> even though it always feels like I'll be number two.
>
> To someone you can't hold anymore,
>
> if you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before.

But, sadly, also in off the table

> [Ariana]
>
> Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully,
>
> but it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again, babe.

And, in Save Your Tears

> [Ariana's verse]
>
> I couldn't help it I put you through hell.
>
> ...
>
> Boy take me back cause I wanna stay,
>
> Save your tears for another day.

Ariana blurred by randomizing through possibilities, but the true answer is written in "Escape from LA", already:

> She pulled up to the studio.
>
> Nobody's watching.
>
> She closed the door and then she locked it for me, for me.
>
> Nobody walked in.
>
> I cut my verse and then she popped it for me, for me.
>
> ...
>
> She's all mine for the night.
>
> She's all mine until she calls her line.
