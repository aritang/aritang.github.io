I spend the weekend in Los Angeles.

LA is flamboyant, loud, of beautiful, bold contrasts—definitely one of a kind. Beneath the Hollywood glam and tourist traps, there’s a real depth to the city. I walked throught its most diverse neighborhoods in the world—Koreatown, Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and the Arts District all have their own unique cultures and communities. I think all will find a niche in LA that their heart recide.
