Tomorrow (Nov. 17) marks the grand finale of the Shanghai International Art Festival. The closing performance features the esteemed **Munich Philharmonic**, led by **Tugan Sokhiev**, with the brilliant pianist **Haochen Zhang** gracing the stage.

The program offers a sumptuous feast of late-Romantic repertoire, showcasing three well-loved classics:

- Tchaikovsky | Polonaise from *Eugene Onegin*
- Tchaikovsky | Piano Concerto No.1
- Rimsky-Korsakov | *Scheherazade*

Interestingly, Tchaikovsky’s *Polonaise* also made an appearance as an encore during the ***opening*** performance in September, presented by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra under Long Yu:

Netizens had quite a bit to say about Long Yu's rendition, describing it as “too loud and rushed,” “overly celebratory,” and “lacking the finesse of a proper crescendo.” A certain sharpness in the trumpet’s opening notes doesn’t exactly help its case. 

Long Yu has often been associated with imitating Karajan, though some might argue he’s taken Karajan’s more controversial traits—the rigidity, the fixation on exaggerated dynamics—without quite capturing the mastery behind them.

Now, I don’t mind a touch of drama in a conductor’s approach, but when crescendos feel like sudden traffic jams and fortissimos arrive like uninvited guests, perhaps it’s time to recalibrate. Karajan himself was no stranger to accusations of control-freak tendencies, but at least he wielded his obsessiveness with precision. For imitators, however, the line between homage and overkill can be perilously thin.

In contrast, Tugan Sokhiev brings a breath of fresh air. Under his baton, the Munich Philharmonic exudes grandeur, elegance, and a certain versatility that avoids the traps of overindulgence. Imagine a Karajan minus the heavy-handedness—stress-free yet still commanding. Here’s a rendition to cleanse the palate:

It's like a great conductor doesn’t just lead an orchestra, he dances with it. If tomorrow’s performance lives up to this promise, it will indeed be a fitting close to the festival.
