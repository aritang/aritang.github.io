Back in February, I picked Sabrina Carpenter as a next big thing in music on my blog: see post [the IDGAS energy in Sabrina Carpenter's 'Nonsense'](/posts/nonsense/). Now, she’s topping the charts with her album *Short n Sweet* and its hit singles. You can see for yourself on the [Billboard Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/artist/sabrina-carpenter/chart-history/tlp/).

It's exciting to see a prediction come true, especially when it's about an artist as talented as Sabrina. Her team’s smart choices and her catchy tracks have clearly paid off.

Keep following for more music insights! Like who knows, maybe another spot-on prediction.
