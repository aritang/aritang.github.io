In the spirit of Karl Lagerfeld who once said, "***I like the idea of craziness with discipline***," it all started with an assignment from my professor about Google’s cookie and privacy policies. I was supposed to research how cookies influence ad targeting and how collected privacy data is processed, stored and used. But reading about it from all sources wasn’t barely enough for my appetite—so, I turned to something even more exhiliarting:

**Use this blog as a testing ground, I set up my own Google Ad campaign.**

It wasn't a lot of work: figuring out some technical details (basically, it's just installing all the necessary HTML tags and enable developer mod in the source code of the website), set up the campaign (think of ad headlines and logos). Finally, **segmented** (aka target) my audience, set budget, and launch, my for-the-first-time-in-forever, advertisement campaign.

Now, my ads are live, and I’m spending over $20 a day. It’s crazy, fun, and deeply educational—really, like when one step into the shoes of the advertiser, all the seemingly absurd constraints and incentives in the literatures suddenly come alive. I couldn’t be more excited about and even, a little proud of what I’ve managed to do. Stay tuned and I'll update what happens later.
