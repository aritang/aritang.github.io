Strava, a fitness-tracking company, faced criticism after its global heatmap unintentionally exposed the locations of sensitive military bases worldwide. The heatmap aggregates and anonymizes public data from users who share their exercise routes, but in remote areas, this data can reveal concentrations of military personnel.

Strave included a total 1 billion activities from all Strava data through September 2017. They claim to have a global heatmap that is the ***largest, richest, and most beautiful*** dataset of its kind. Indeed, look at the light up running paths on Stanford:

But, it turns out that not only Stanford students are keen in bragging about their burnt calories. Lieutenants going for their 7am jog every morning lit up the routes outlining their secret military bases.

According to the [news](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases)

> Strava demonstrated that the new heatmap was detailed enough to see kiteboarding in Mexico, to track the route of the Camino de Santiago across northern Spain and to see the sea route of the Ironman triathalon in Kona, Hawaii. Perhaps the closest to the current operational security issues that it noted, however, was the layout of the Burning Man festival in the Nevadan desert. “The unique pentagonal pattern of Burning Man’s pop-up city is forever etched into the Heatmap, thanks to all the runners and cyclists who have used Strava to explore it,” [the company wrote](https://blog.strava.com/galleries/heatmap/).
