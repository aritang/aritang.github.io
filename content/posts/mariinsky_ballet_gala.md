Mariinsky Ballet at Shanghai, Oct. 23 2024. Ballet Gala. Don Quixote Act II pas de deux. 

One nice thing about ballet is that you can cheer and applause during the performance—so it's worthwhile to watch it live (even from the third floor)—to be among the audience and enjoy the awe.

The ballerina wasn't technically 100% perfect—you can observe a tiny trip at 11s. Yet the audience was ignited and she got thundering applause.
