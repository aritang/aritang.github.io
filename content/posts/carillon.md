There's a ***carillon*** on the top of the Rockefeller Chapel at University of Chicago.

It's kinda like a piano, but instead of strings or pipes (like an organ), Carillons use **bronze bells** of different sizes, each producing a distinct pitch. The Rockefeller one operates pure mechanically.

One very interesting fact about Carillon: its overtone is minor third, not major third.

### The minor-third overtone of bells

Normal instruments, whose sound produced by a string or air column, the harmonic series follows **integer multiples** of the fundamental note. For example, when you play the note C on a piano, what you hear is

- Fundamental: the basic note C1 (1×frequency)
- 2nd partial: octave C2 (2×)
- 3rd partial: perfect fifth G2 (3×)
- 4th partial: second octave C3 (4×)
- **5th partial: major third above the 2nd octave E3 (5×), etc.**

Carillons are different. Unlike one-dimensional strings or simple pipes, bells are three-dimensional vibrating shells. So they are not harmonic resonators . When struck, a bell produces inharmonic partials, not neat integer multiples. The exact overtone pattern depends on the geometry of the bell (thickness, curvature, profile). For the typical Western church bell:

- The **“nominal” partial** (perceived pitch) isn’t even the lowest vibration mode.
- Prominent partials include the *hum note* (an octave below the nominal), the *prime* (the perceived fundamental), the *tierce*(a **minor third** above), the *quint* (a fifth above), and the *nominal* (an octave above the prime).

This *tierce* partial is why bells often sound “minor” or “mournful” — the strong minor third clashes with what our ears expect from harmonic overtones. Therefore, honesly, Pachelbel's *Canon in D* sounds really weird when playing on a carillon — couples, hire a harp or a string quartet for your wedding!

Btw, the Rockefeller Chapel's tower has the best view on campus (no elevator though)

{{<figure align="center" src="/art/chicago_skyline.jpeg" caption="The tower at the bottom is the Economic Department of UChicago.  [here](/art/booth_from_rc.jpeg) which is usually not available anywhere else online." width="100%">}}

You can also get a rare **bird view of Booth School of Business**:
