The Art Institute of Chicago boasts one of the world's finest collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. If you're a frequent gallery visitor, one Monet won't be too much of a surprise. But a walls of Monet's Wheatstacks would still be impressive... The following is one of my favourite.

Btw, really good short introduction for impressionism:

> ## The Triumph of Impressionism
>
> In the 1870s, a group of young artists, who would be known as the Impressionists, redefined what a painting should be. At the time, ordinary people and places were not considered important subjects, and paintings were supposed to look as if the artist had labored on the work over a long period of time. The Impressionists disagreed with these conventions; both their choices in subject and style defied the strict rules of the official art system. These artists were united by their interest in representing the modern world of their daily experience-particularly the parks, boulevards, and public spaces found in Paris, its suburbs, and the countryside. Their vibrant colors and loose, tactile brushstrokes were meant to show that they worked outdoors rather than confined within the studio. The success of the Impressionists helped give future artists more freedom to choose their own subjects and experiment with new styles.
