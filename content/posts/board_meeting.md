As I walked into the grandiose setting of our school's annual board meeting, a thought struck me - meetings are a peculiar trade-off. We exchange our precious time, hoping to gain something intangible yet potentially valuable. This meeting, with its ceremonial grandeur, was a perfect example to reflect on this paradox.

Our school had transformed the largest meeting room into a spectacle. A massive circular table dominated the center, surrounded by a hundred student volunteers, including myself. It resembled less of a meeting and more of a performance, a ceremonial act where real discussions were replaced by pre-decided scripts and roles.

This spectacle got me thinking about the different types of meetings we attend and their true purpose. On the surface, meetings are about idea exchange, collaboration, and expanding one's network. Yet, as I observed at this event, they can often turn into mere vanity fairs.

Consider the attendees: there were the necessary functional figures like the principal and board members, whose presence was crucial. Then, there were 'fillers', department heads roped in to create an aura of importance. Their role was akin to an audience at a concert - necessary for the performers but passive in participation.

In typical meetings, attendees' roles vary according to their status and objectives. At the top are keynote speakers and distinguished guests, followed by those above a certain 'threshold' who aim to expand their influence. Then come the participants hovering around or below this threshold, seeking to 'socialize upwards' by absorbing new ideas or building connections. And, of course, there are people like me - volunteers or attendees primarily there for the fringe benefits, like networking breaks or, in my case, delicious cakes and free merchandise.

But who truly benefits from such meetings? In the case of our board meeting, it wasn't an enriching ground for meaningful exchanges or learning. The formality and lack of diverse specialties among attendees made it less than ideal for genuine interaction. While the board members and principal needed this exposure, I wondered if they found any joy in the lengthy, exhausting proceedings.

For us volunteers, though, the day wasn't without its perks. I walked away with a free hoodie, some quality stationery, and my fill of snacks and fresh juice that later I even shared with friends. So, in a way, my time was well-compensated.

As I reflect on this experience, I realize that the value of meetings lies not just in their content but also in their context. The true worth of any meeting, be it a high-profile board gathering or a casual team huddle, hinges on the genuine connections made and the knowledge exchanged - elements that were notably absent in the spectacle I witnessed.

Meetings, therefore, are a complex blend of necessity, opportunity, and sometimes, mere formality. The challenge lies in discerning which meetings warrant our time and which are merely grand stages for the age-old dance of vanity.
