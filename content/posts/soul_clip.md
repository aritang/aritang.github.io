This is one of the scenes that resonates with my current phase and inspires me a lot.

> [Joe] (After the successful performace) So uh, what happens next?

> [Dorothea] We come back tomorrow night and do it all...[pause] 
>
> What's wrong, teacher?

> [Joe] It's just i've been waiting on this day for my entire life. I thought I'd feel different.

> [Dorothea] I heard this story about a fish. The fish swims up to this older fish and says, "I'm trying to find this thing they call the ocean."
>
> "The ocean?" says the older fish. That's what you're in right now.
>
> "This?" says the young fish. "This is water. What I want is the ocean."

### See you tomorrow.
