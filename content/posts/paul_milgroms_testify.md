The *DOJ v Google* antitrust trial comes to an end—lasting only three weeks. Before the recap and a detailed dive down into Google's defense, here's two fun/exciting news:

## Prof. Paul Milgrom testifies for Google

The DOJ is going to have a hard time. Google certainly knows to get the best person to do the job. According to Tom Blakely from inside the courtroom:

> As soon as his testimony began, I realized [Prof. Paul Milgrom] would be a formidable witness, not just because of his outstanding intellect and subject matter expertise, but because he is the kind of witness that is simply challenging for a counterparty to deal with. An older gentleman, he was equal parts charming, intelligent, poised, unflagging while enduring hours on the stand, and spoke with the quiet confidence and humility of the wisdom of his years.

Paul Milgrom's testify won't be some scratch on the surface—the DOJ's gonna have some hard time. I'm looking forward to Google's detail defense materials as this would be an excellent dive into the market structure from one of the best in the industry.

And lastly, come on, it's Paul Milgrom...

> By presenting with charisma, charm, wit, and as one person described to me during a break, “**grandpa vibes**”:

(Nah, the DOJ's lawyer probably freaked out upon seeing Paul on their counterparty)
