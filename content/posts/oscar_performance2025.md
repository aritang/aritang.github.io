2025's Oscar opening is amazing. Ariana Grande sang "Somewhere Over the Rainbow":

The performance is classy. A lot of information is hidden in the references. Particularly, at the very beginning before everything starts, the Orchestra tuned (on the key A). I think this is a remarkable and important signal that showcase realness and nostalgia. And of course, flashing cash like "yeahhh we oscar hires a live orchestra"...
