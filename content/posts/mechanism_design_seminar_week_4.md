## Motivation

Preview from [problem set 2](https://www.fuhuthu.com/Mechanism24/ps2.pdf), question 4:

This gives a reduction: [submodular welfare maximization] <= [maximize a monotone submodular function s.t. matroid constarint].

### Remarks: complexity

1. (Is it true though) [submodular welfare maximization] >= [maximize a monotone submodular function s.t. matroid constarint].
2. maximize monotone submodular function is hard, because one can reduce Partition problem to it.

Notice that, general 

That's why we started looking at submodular maximization s.t. matroid constraint in last week. To begin with, the
