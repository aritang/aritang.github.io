Sabrina Carpenter's hit *Nonsense* is a great song, both artistically and commercially. The song gives a "I-DONT-GIVE-A-SHIT" (IDGAS) energy. The singer herself said in Genius VERIFIED interview

> "...we were hitting a lot of walls and we're like, you know what, let's just literally write nonsense, no joke. and that's how the song happened."
>
> "A lot of our justification for lyrics was well it's nonsense. so it doesn't have to make any sense at all and we just have fun."

The song can be streamed in [YouTube](https://youtu.be/YcSP1ZUf1eQ?si=6waX2iqWcTpdiJnJ). It start with a improvised humming along the chords, out of the singer's lower range, giving a relaxed vibe. Following on, the song makes a swift and light, teasingly flirtive R&B pop. It's just not serious - the lyricism breaks the fourth wall every now and then, like

> And when you got your arms around me,
>
> oh it, feel so good
>
> I had to jump the octave (the lead vocal literally jumped an octave here, btw)

Genius. It's remarkable artistry. The song kinda reminds me a lot about Ariana Grande btw - Sabrina's timbre and range, the vocal runs and adlibs and the R&B beat productions... This one particularly, is like a more relaxed, less polished, natural version, akin to some AG's 'unreleased'. Particularly, MONOPOLY (AG feat. Victoria Mon√©t) kinda gives a similar energy. 

Remark. Nonsense becomes hit first on TikTok. Teens like its carelessly written outro particularly, for examples, lyrics like "how quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz" sang in a fuzzy, informal manner. So it was cut, sped-up and spread like viral. This IDGAS energy was so prominent, that my dad notice it instantly when I first car-played this song, he was like "Why is she singing like this and why do they sound all the same? I miss Celine Dion and the serious vocalists back then...".
