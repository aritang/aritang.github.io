**Definition** ***Overture*** is a music instrumental introduction to a ballet or opera. During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn composed overtures which were independent, self-existing, instrumental, programmatic works that foreshadowed genres such as the symphonic poem. In motion pictures, an overture is a piece of music setting the mood for the film before the opening credits start. 

Here's a list of my favourite overtures. Ranked w.r.t. listening frequency:

- Felix Mendelssohn: A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture in E Major, Op. 21.

    The work's **lightness of touch, melodic charm, moderated yet passionate forward momentum and formal clarity** fully characterized Mendelssohn's beauty.

- Main Titles - The Little Mermaid. Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.

    > Disney reached new heights in 1989 with a soundtrack for an animated movie that had both kids and parents singing along. Alan Menken’s masterful compositions and Howard Ashman's lively lyrics make all the difference, but they’re helped by the big voice of Jodi Benson belting outcast anthem “Part of Your World” as Ariel the mermaid. The deliciously devilish “Les Poissons” is another standout, while a crustacean band and calypso beats add to the fun on tracks like “Kiss the Girl” and the GRAMMY®-winning “Under the Sea”.

- Strauss Jr.: Overture zu Die Fledermaus.

    Johann Strauss II is perhaps one of the most crazily prolific composers. But what makes ***Die Fledermaus*** stands out is perhaps Herbert von Karajan's rendition – the New Year's Concert in Vienna in 1987. Karajan tends to push too hard on tempo for waltz in general, but his momentum is perfect for this piece of unbounded vitality.
