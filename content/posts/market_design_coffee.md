Every week, something extraordinary happens at Stanford, and I count myself incredibly fortunate to have been a part of it on several occasions. It's the market design coffee hosted by Alvin, a gathering that's as enlightening as it is exhilarating.

I recently stumbled upon [a LinkedIn blog](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tinglong_i-had-the-honor-of-spending-one-hour-with-activity-7136425246017884160-Xw_P?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by Professor Tingling Dai from Johns Hopkins University, detailing his experiences at these gatherings. His words captured the essence of what makes these sessions so special. One particular paragraph from Prof. Dai's blog struck a chord with me:

> Al is not only inspiring, but he really takes the time and effort to lift everyone up and make the field of market design more inclusive (rather than exclusive).
>
> In the most charming and kind way possible, Al challenges us all to think about what's possible with our scholarship, our community, and our world.
