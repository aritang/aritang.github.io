Music is at the perfect intersection of math and art. The technical part of music theory especially chords analysis is exactly an elevated version of modular arithmatic from a mathematical perspectives. Scores are encoded scripts of melodies that can be decoded and played out. Bach particularly, stands as the top composer to be considered as arcanely mathematical and artistically beautiful. 

Here's [an interesting post](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/secret-mathematical-patterns-revealed-in-bachs-music/) in Scientific American by Elise Cutts, about how Physicists found that the music of Johann Sebastian Bach contains mathematical patterns that help convey information.

> By representing scores as simple networks of dots, called nodes, connected by lines, called edges, scientists quantified the information conveyed by hundreds of Bach’s compositions.

> So Kulkarni boiled down 337 Bach compositions into webs of interconnected nodes and calculated the information entropy of the resulting networks. In these networks, each note of the original score is a node, and each transition between notes is an edge. For example, if a piece included an E note followed by a C and a G played together, the node representing E would be connected to the nodes representing C and G.

> Networks of note transitions in Bach’s music packed more of an informational punch than randomly generated networks of the same size—the result of greater variation in the networks’ nodal degrees, or the number of edges connected to each node. Additionally, the scientists uncovered variation in the information structure and content of Bach’s many compositional styles. Chorales, a type of hymn meant to be sung, yielded networks that were relatively sparse in information, though still more information-rich than randomly generated networks of the same size. Toccatas and preludes, musical styles that are often written for keyboard instruments such as the organ, harpsichord and piano, had higher information entropy.

The original paper ***[Information content of note transitions in the music of J. S. Bach](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013136)*** is out in Phys. Rev. Research's on Feb. 6th, 2024. I am immensely interested in the detail of how they encoded scores into graphs and analyze information contained in Bach's music. As the author themselves said "our simple framework serves as a stepping stone for exploring further musical complexities, creativity, and questions therein", it might be cool to integrate this technique with [some recent information design theories](https://aritang.github.io/posts/suspense_n_surprise/).
