> IT IS THE OIL ON CANVAS THAT BIVA PRESENTED IN PARIS AT THE 1910 SALON UNDER THE NUMBER 206. Henri Biva displays all his talent as an academic and naturalist painter. The salons were, let’s not forget, competitions, and the works presented were of an exceptional level: the young artists played their career there. For those whose fame was already established, the salons were an opportunity to further develop their reputation and they exhibited « out of competition » which is the case of this painting. 
>
> One should note the perfect balance of the composition, the particular care given to the treatment of the vegetation and its reflections on the water of the pond, the remarkable ability of the artist to represent the constant and perceptible variations of light. This work is in absolutely perfect condition.
