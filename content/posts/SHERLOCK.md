This is a trailor of ***SHERLOCK*** - my machine learning final project. I've really been obsessively perfecting my final course thesis (as we've talked about it before [here](/posts/obsessed/)). Though immensely energy and time consuming, they're just for fun but I'm proud of them for their beauty.

### **Abstract**

> We introduce SHERLOCK, an innovative machine learning model designed to differentiate human-written code from AI-generated code in educational settings. By combining perturbation analysis with advanced machine learning, SHERLOCK significantly outperforms existing detection techniques, achieving a precision rate over 0.8 and a model score beyond 0.75. Our contribution addresses a critical need in maintaining academic integrity in programming courses amidst the rise of AI coding tools, marking an interesting direction to the field of AI-generated content detection.

The course thesis is long... cause students are incentivized towards GPA after all. But here we might be more genuine and, the plan is, to write a short, clear explain of this project. Stay tuned for tmrw!
