The July 2025 [Sigecom Exchanges Newsletter](https://www.sigecom.org/exchanges/index.html) has this really interesting article that our advisor reposted in our WeChat group:

> ## EconCS in Industry: Skills to Succeed as an Applied Scientist

> Devanur, Paes Leme and Schrijvers [link](https://www.sigecom.org/exchanges/volume_23/1/DEVANUR.pdf)

It applies more to EconCS students **from the CS side**, but the key points are universal for anyone wishing for industry I guess. Some key takeaways:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**

    > Exploratory Data Analysis is the iterative process of learning properties of the data that you’re working with. Typically, you start with a question or hypothesis (e.g. “the bids in an auction come from a Myerson-regular distribution”), then summarize, visualize, or model your data, and finally use what you learn to ask new questions.

    To me, this is really about developing the ability to **understand real-world problems through data** — and more importantly, to **find new problems from the patterns you uncover**. With LLMs making coding easier than ever, the harder skill now is building the logical framework to process data, extract structure, and abstract it into new ideas.

- **Machine Learning and Statistics**  
    At minimum, take solid intro courses in both ML and Stats.

- **Coding Mindset**  
    It’s not just about learning a language like Python or C++.  
    (i) You need **software-engineering-level intuition**: how to read documentation, debug effectively, and review code thoughtfully.  
    (ii) At a more advanced level, you should also be comfortable operating distributed systems.

One final thought: beyond technical skills, it really helps to stay **open-minded**. As students, we benefit from exploring ideas across disciplines and staying patient with unfamiliar jargon or frameworks — even when they seem unintuitive or “messy” at first. Some of the most interesting insights come from learning to see through someone else’s lens.
