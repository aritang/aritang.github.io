Something fun for April 1st: Goofy (and economically spicy) IP bleaches—aka, **copycats**!

### Miu Miu vs. Zara

Miu Miu is high fashion. Zara is high speed. One sells couture dreams; the other sells dreams on clearance.

For trendy (and budget-aware) fashion girls, Zara is a cheat code—you can literally **recreate** an entire Miu Miu look for about 5% of the price.

{{<figure align="center" src="/baidu/zara_miumiu.jpeg" caption="TikTok is full of tutorials showing how to turn YSL, Miu Miu, or Prada show into a Zara haul." width="100%">}}

So what makes Zara so successful? First, they have the world's best  supply chain—Zara's supply chain is renowned for its agility and efficiency, a benchmark in the fast fashion industry. Second, Zara’s legal team is famous for **dodging** patent lawsuits...

> Zara's mother company, [Inditex](https://www.inditex.cn/itxcomweb/es/en/home), has a legal team that's practically legendary. Zara's knack for "borrowing" high-end designs keeps luxury brands on their toes.
>
> While luxury labels take about six months to launch new designs, Zara can whip up similar styles and have them in stores within two weeks. Legally, if Zara tweaks at least seven details from the original, it's not considered a copy. This clever strategy showcases the combined brilliance of Zara's designers and legal team.
>
> Luxury brands have tried to fight back. Around 2011, Christian Louboutin sued Zara in France for allegedly copying his iconic red-soled shoes. Despite the heated battle, French courts sided with Zara, noting the differences and deeming Louboutin's trademark too vague without a specific color code. Louboutin even had to pay about $3,600 in legal costs to Zara France...

### Porsche vs. Mi

Porsche (say it like *"Porsh-uh"*) is a legendary German car brand.
 Mi is a Chinese tech giant dabbling in, well, pretty much everything.

Its CEO once said, “We’re learning from Apple. In all ways.” Translation: We’re watching... and cloning.

Apple hasn’t released a car yet. So in February 2025, Mi beat them to the punch with the **Xiaomi SU7 Ultra**, starting at RMB 529,900 (about 73000USD). It looks *suspiciously familiar*:

Btw, Mi’s design is totally legal—Porsche 911’s exterior design patent had already expired around 2018.

In China, folks are in on the joke:  “Who needs a Porsche when you can get the vibes for less?” Luxury flex is out. Practical mock-flex is in.
