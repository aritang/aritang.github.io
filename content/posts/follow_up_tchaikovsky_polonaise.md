The closing performance of the Shanghai International Art Festival, by **Tugan Sokhiev** and the **Munich Philharmonic**  was nothing short of extraordinary!

While high-quality recordings can provide an astonishingly immersive experience for solo or chamber works—especially with a decent set of headphones. But only live orchestral performances can achieve the stunning scale and acoustic intricacies of a grand compositions. The emotional depth of Tchaikovsky’s *Piano Concerto No. 1* and the vivid storytelling in Rimsky-Korsakov’s *Scheherazade* were rendered with such mastery that no recording could ever hope to capture their full impact. This performance was a reminder of why orchestras like this exist: to make music alive, dynamic, and immersive.

And just when we thought the night couldn’t get better, they gave us a cheeky encore: the *Russian Dance* from *The Nutcracker*. A playful, fiery finale to a breathtaking evening.

If you ever have the chance to see Sokhiev and the Munich Philharmonic live, grab it. No recording will ever compare. Btw, buy the seat **behind the stage**, if possible. Sokhiev is such a cute conductor to watch😍😍😍😍😍😍😍.
