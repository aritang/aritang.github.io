In Glenn Gould's critical commentary on Mozart's especially late piano concerti, he nevertheless adores Mozart's early works:

> In his early works Mozart came very close to realizing the possibilities for experiment that would exist within even the most stylized form. His early sonatas concertos and Symphonies were extraordinarily flexible and inventive to a degree that he never quite equaled later on.
>
> My Mozart preference is for the work of his teenage years and as far as the piano sonatas are concerned those which he wrote during and shortly after his visit to Paris, which took place during his 22 year. These are glorious pieces lean fastidious and possessed of that infallible tonal homing instinct with which the young Mozart was so generously endowed. and despite everything that I've been saying in these last few minutes, I love them. (Glenn Gould from "How Mozart Became a Bad Composer")

At the end of *How Mozart Became a Bad Composer*, Glenn Gould performed an earlier piano work by Mozartâ€”**Piano Sonata No. 13 in B-flat Major, K.333** (1783). He played with a lightheartedly fast tempo which beautifully captures the original Mozart's spirit (given that Mozart should be playing a ***[fortepiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortepiano#:~:text=February%202019,to%20the%20early%2019th%20century.)*** (like, Piano-mini) in small aristocratic musical salons instead a full-sized Steinway in a modern grand concert hall):

Btw, if you still prefer a more well-paced version, check out one of Grigory Sokolov's live performance of K.333, which is included in the album [Purcell & Mozart](https://store.deutschegrammophon.com/en/products/grigory-sokolov-purcell-mozart) and is available on YouTube if you (or your IP) is in Europe:
