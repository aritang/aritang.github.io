Guiyang's food well reflects ths city's geographical and humanity spirit. Historical reasons (see this blog "[Title]()" for a callback) makes people to endorse pepper-heavy spicy food. Moreover, this city, not being an economic/finance/trade/political center, rather Guiyang is just a small city reciding on its own in the middle of mountains â€” makes its food more of a *culinary anarchist*.
