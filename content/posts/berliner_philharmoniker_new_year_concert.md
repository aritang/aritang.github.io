The Berliner Philharmoniker has its New Year's **<u>Eve</u>** Concert celebrating the transition of the years on 31 December. The problem with new year's concerts is that usually they are roamed with cliché repertoire and often, dizzy post-alchoholic audience. Like, it's good be festive, but stuffing the entire program with encore pieces is self-degrading in some way.

The Berliner Philharmoniker stands sliiighly more serious—the orchestra presents a carefully selected program every year, featuring a  beautiful blend of their leading composers, distinguished guests and of course, the remarkable musicians.

Every year the program is carefully selected (not merely revised with some minor change). Although the pieces are still classical hits, you can tell every year has its personality and focus. For example, 2024's program:

The recordings are available on Berlin Philharmonic's Digital Concert Hall—and of course, you might wanna do a search in **Bilibili** before this.
