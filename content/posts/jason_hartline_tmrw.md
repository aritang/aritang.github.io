WINE day 3. Interesting talks continued. This conference is amazing that nice people with amazing works are literally everywhere. And I'm glad to be among them as one of the motivated passionate newbies.

At lunch, I found a gentleman and me stuck before the coffee machine, trying to find a paper cup so as to sneak some extra coffee from the canteen. Me, as a shameless young people free to act indecent, just stretched and grabbed some paper cups from the back of the coffee counter and shared it with the gentleman - we happily got coffee and was ready to leave. It was not until leaving that I casually asked his name and found out that he's JASON HARTLINE.

Followed was a non-stop stream of OMGs - I just couldn't stop cause it happens when you've read a lot of his papers, his book and some of his course materials about strategic grading. Once again, amazing people walking around everywhere, and you never know how small the world can be.
