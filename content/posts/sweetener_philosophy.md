*written by Ariana, in 2023 Spring*

I prefer slipper,

I prefer shorts.

I prefer some messy breakfast stand,

than that furnished coffee store.

I prefer seminar to blown-up symposiums.

I prefer fantasia to operatic symphonies.

I prefer my math and music in minimalistic solo,

instead of bullshits stacked and piled.

I prefer beef offal under summer banyans,

I prefer downpour of flash and storm.

I prefer Guangzhou where my spirit dwells,

than here in Shanghai that my body grounds, but my mind’s elsewhere floatin’.
