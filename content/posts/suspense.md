summary: a little about music, and application of suspense (aka procrastination)
---

Listening to demos and unreleased tracks is like reading an artist's diary. Demos can often be found in deluxe version of original soundtracks, unreleased snippets, alternative version of pop songs popping in YouTube etc.. It's raw, giving us a glimpse of the artists' original thoughts before the music was polished for release. When you compare these early versions with the final tracks, you notice the changes. Maybe an instrument was toned down, or a background harmony shifted. These small differences can be eye-opening, showing us how a piece of music evolves. Itâ€™s like finding little treasures that give us more than just a three-minute song; they give us a story.

Btw, forgive my suspense (procrastination). Tmrw would feature a new exposition of the paper ***suspense n surprise***. Follow up.
