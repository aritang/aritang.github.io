"Never go to bed without kissing goodnight"––Here's my favourite lyrics from the closing single of Ariana Grande's new album ***eternal sunshine***, 'ordinary things' featuring Ariana's Nonna:

> You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
>
> You hit like my biggest fan when I hear what the critiques say
>
> You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late
>
> I don't need no diamonds, just your time
