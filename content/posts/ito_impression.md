I could go on about how social media has revolutionized business models in the hyperconnected age. When there are seemingly infinite exposures online, even a 0.01% yield rate can turn a million views into thousands of sales. So now, popularity often <u>correlates</u> with quality, but the cause-n-effect interplay is meddled by the algorithm’s invisible hand.

For one, algorithms amplify what’s already popular—so now, people drive *past* Izu-shi's most splendid costal line in Japan—forget about the mountains, sunrise in private onsens by the sea—to cluster in *Izu Saboten Zoo* to see Capybara Outdoor bath:

There’s something magical about Capybaras. They embody coziness as if it’s their life’s mission (e.g. you can put an orange on top of their head still they remains inact).

Watching them sit in hot springs with steam rising around, you will be like, hey, life doesn’t always need to be rushed or overthought all the time. Inspired by this profound revelation, visitors gather en masse, jostling for position, cameras raised high to capture the Capybaras' zen-like repose. Afterward, they shuffle toward the gift shop, engaging in fierce competition for limited-edition Capybara plushies.
