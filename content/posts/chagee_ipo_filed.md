Beverage brands that went public: Nayuki's Tea, Chabaidao, and Guming—all in HK. Recently, MiXue joined (see this blog: ***[The giant bubble tea chain Mixue IPO in HK](/posts/mixues_ipo/)***). Cotti is competing fiercely with Luckin (See  blog***[The intensified price war between COTTI and Luckin](/posts/between_cotti_and_luckin/)***). Will it be next?
