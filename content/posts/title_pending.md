The world of football once again witnessed a momentous occasion as Lionel Messi clinched The Best FIFA Men's Player award, while Pep Guardiola was honored as the best coach. As a fervent admirer of both figures, this dual triumph resonates deeply with me, offering a blend of joy and professional intrigue. CONGRATULATIONS!

This recent accolade for Messi isn't just a testament to his unparalleled skill on the field:  the Ballon d'Or, a topic I've previously touched upon ([see my earlier post](/posts/ballon_dor/)), serves as a prime example of this intersection between sports and economics - just look into its voting mechanism and there would be highly interesting network patterns and bias and randomness. 

Football, often viewed through the lens of passion and athleticism, also offers a fertile ground for economic research. The sport, in its complexity and global appeal, provides a unique framework to apply and test economic theories. It's a notion that might seem counterintuitive, given the stereotypical image of economists as mathematically inclined and less sporty individuals. Yet, there lies an untapped potential in this field, rich with data and human elements that could yield intriguing insights.

For example, Ignacio Huerta's "Beautiful Game Theory" is a pioneering work in this regard. It peels back the layers of football, revealing how economic principles can be applied to understand strategies, behaviors, and outcomes within the sport. The book serves as a compelling argument for why economists should turn their analytical gaze towards the football pitch. For sure, in this synthesis of sport and science, we can uncover new insights that transcend the boundaries of the pitch and the spreadsheet.
