I am on to a week's trip to Japan. Here's for a brief exhale from life. Along the way, I’ll share impressions of the five cities on our planned route—assuming we make it to them all.

My family and I hit Kobe as the first stop. It's a coastal city just across from Osaka. As I write this, I’m lying in bed at the remm plus hotel in Kobe Sannomiya.

Kobe is perhaps best known for its "Kobe beef," the pinnacle of the famed A5-grade steak. Naturally, one must try Kobe beef while here. The most celebrated way to enjoy it is either raw or prepared by a chef in front of you, **teppanyaki**-style.

 But there’s more to Kobe than its legendary beef. Historically one of Japan’s first harbors to open to the world, Kobe has a quiet cosmopolitan charm. It feels prosperous in an understated way, blending traditional Japanese aesthetics with a touch of Western influence. You’ll find excellent coffee, fine wine, cozy Spanish restaurants, and bakeries that deliver incredible quality at fair prices.

Unlike Shanghai, which almost demands reverence, Kobe invites you to experience its harmony—a place where Western influences enhance rather than overshadow the city’s serene lifestyle.
