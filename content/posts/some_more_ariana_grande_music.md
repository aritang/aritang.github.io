Ariana Grande is a paragon of aesthetic and disposition that I strive to emulate. Her music has been a constant companion, resonating with me on levels I didn't fully comprehend in my youth. Initially, I was captivated by the surface beauty of her melodies and the power of her voice, but as I matured, I began to appreciate the depth of her lyrical prowess, the intricate vocal layers and the intentionality behind her artistry. Her influence extends beyond her music. She embodies a work ethic and a dedication to her craft that I find admirable.

Here's a review of the past ten days, as we traversed this melodic odyssey to revisit the ten songs that epitomize her transformative impact on the contemporary music scene. The featured songs in this journey are:

1. [The Way (feat. Mac Miller)](/posts/the_way) - journey back to the beginnings of love, where every touch feels like the first.
2. [Tattooed Heart](/posts/tattooed_heart1) \- an intimate pledge of everlasting love, inked onto the soul with the indelible ink of affection.
3. [Focus](posts/focus) - "I'm over here doing what I like"– remember that all you need is to zero in on what truly matters.
4. [sweetener](/posts/jason~) - a sugary serenade that adds a spoonful of optimism to the bitter brew of life.
5. [goodnight n go](/posts/goodnight_n_go1) - it features the most gorgeous humming in this tender lullaby, that blurs the lines between longing and letting go
6. [get well soon](/posts/get_well_soon) - the echoing melody of love and heal
7. [imagine](/posts/imagine) - an impossible escape to a world where love knows no bounds and all regrets come true
8. [needy](/posts/needy) - a candid confession of vulnerability, wrapped in the soft embrace of self-awareness
9. [34+35](/posts/34_35) - a playful romp through the mathematics of desire
10. [just like magic](/posts/just_like_magic2) - the song that shoud be played every, morning.

The list is certainly far from exhaustive. There's **Side to Side**, the provocatively sexy collaboration with Nicki Minaj that boasts over 2 billion streams on YouTube, singing about the aftermath of intense physical affection. Not to mention the notoriously catchy **7 rings** and the ubiquitous **thank u, next**. But there's more to explore in her repertoire: the exceptionally emotional and intimate love ballads **pov** and **ghostin**, the cynical yet playful **NASA**, and the provocatively titled **break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored**, among others. 

What's special about Ariana Grande is that, with every released song, there are often one or more [half-finished demos](https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Unreleased_Songs) that never made it to formal release (and possibly wouldn't have, had Ariana not set her iCloud password to "Ariana123"). Grande's discography is a treasure trove of selective, polished, unblemished masterpieces.

So concludes my ten-day embarkation on a musical reflection with Ariana Grande. Each day brought a new appreciation for her artistry and the depth of her music. While this journey through her songs has come to an end, the melodies and messages will continue to resonate with me. Now, it's time to pivot back to the academic world. Until the next musical adventure, may these songs be an inspire or cure if needed. Take care of yourself, and if possible, someone else too.
