YaXiang Yuan visited SUFE and gave a talk on *Big Data & Optimization*. He beautifully romanced an audience that consisted of curious MBA students, nasty geeky undergrads and a bunch of leaders with diverse backgroundsâ€“appealing to heterogeneous interests with a delicate balance over depth and fun, to make up a lovely Saturday talk is certainly next-level.

Yuan has a background in optimization theory, but his administrative experience 

-- key: problems motivated by data. how to manipulate the data, solve the problem (break down etc.) (theory) and integrate into real world.

a lot to optimization wisdom. very inspiring and enjoyable talk in a Saturday afternoon. humble and open minded attitude is very beautiful.
