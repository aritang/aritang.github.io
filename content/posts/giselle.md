Teatri alla Scala Ballet Company 2024 performed *Giselle* in Shanghai Grand Theatre–for four consecutive nights, from Mar. 22th to 25th. I bought a front row ticket and went for the first night, and was very lucky to see **Nicoletta Manni**'s rendition of Giselle.

It was brilliant, and I want to write something about it. Stay tuned for tomorrow.
