Following the blog about Birdwatch's mechanism design, here's some latest news about it:

> **Community Notes**, formerly known as **Birdwatch**, is a feature on X (formerly Twitter) where contributors can add context such as fact-checks under a post, image or video. It is a community-driven content moderation program, intended to provide helpful and informative context, based on a crowd-sourced system. Notes are applied to potentially misleading content by a bridging algorithm not based on majority rule, but instead agreement from users on different sides of the political spectrum.

Interestingly...

> Elon Musk, the owner of X, considers the program as a game changer and having considerable potential. After a post by Musk received a Community Note, he claimed the program had been manipulated by state actors. (Wikipedia)

The project code is released. Here's its public repository: https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes.
