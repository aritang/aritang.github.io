Two songs from Ariana Grande's debut album *Yours Truly* hold a special place in my heart, and they've earned their spots in my top 10 list. The first is "[The Way](/posts/the_way/)", and the other is "Tattooed Heart". While "The Way" was an immediate hit upon release, "Tattooed Heart" gained recognition more gradually, especially after Grande performed it frequently in her later career, notably during her Sweetener World Tour.

The setlist of the Sweetener World Tour was strategically divided into three sections. The first section featured upbeat, fast-tempo hits perfect for stage performances, such as "God Is A Woman" and "break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored." The second section transitioned into a more intimate and emotional chapter, showcasing songs like "needy" and "sweetener," and culminating with "Tattooed Heart." During this performance, Grande sang at the center of the venue, beneath an artificial moon, creating a captivating atmosphere.

The tour masterfully delved into Grande's intimate self, weaving together a tapestry of emotions, from insecurity and obsession (needy) to vexation (breathin) and self-acknowledgment (NASA, successful, etc.). The journey reached its peak with 'Tattooed Heart', a song that beautifully encapsulates the essence of the tour.">}}

As Grande's techniques and emotional expression matured over her career, she has been able to deliver increasingly compelling live versions of "Tattooed Heart." Her vocal prowess reached new heights, as showcased in the [Sweetener World Tour Charlotte - Birthday Dedication to Mom Special Edition (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLoPyIOFJmA). This performance stands out as the pinnacle among "Tattooed Heart" renditions, characterized by exceptional vocal control. Ariana's artistic finesse shines through as she skillfully navigates each syllable, allowing the words, melodies, and crescendos to intertwine gracefully.
