There's a lovely scene at the end of *Étoile* (2025) (Amazon's TV about ballet), when the boy went to watched the first ballet show and then waited backstage for the ballerina for a date:

{{<figure align="center" src="/art/why_not_peguin.jpeg" caption="'There were a lot of feathers up there... And I (almost) didn't fall asleep!" width="100%">}}

The boy said after his first ballet, probably swan lake

> "There are a lot of feathers. I fall asleep once — but not when you're on stage... **And why a swan? Why not turn her into a penguin?**"

Reminded me of my first time [watching Swan Lake last year](/posts/swan_lake/) (front row!). Guess everyone including those at Swan Lake premier 1877 at the Bolshoi Theatre are overwhelmed by it. 

Étoile's also featured a chaotic modern ballet premiere. The choreographer marched on stage during the performance and start giving instructions (for hours) before finally presenting his new 'Whatever it is' design. Guess Paris audience has a special taste for 'legendary' premieres like [the Rite of Spring](/posts/stravinsky_n_chanel/)?
