I recently came across a great book. ***Class: A Guide Through the American Status System*** by Paul Fussell. The book carefully researched American class system and how they are revealed by how one speak, dress and live.

> Based on careful research and told with grace and wit, Paul Fessell shows how everything people within American society do, say, and own reflects their social status. Detailing the lifestyles of each class, from the way they dress and where they live to their education and hobbies, *Class* is sure to entertain, enlighten, and occasionally enrage readers as they identify their own place in society and see how the other half lives.

A lot of the ideas are somewhat offensiveâ€”read it once you're seeking for fun laughing at others, read it twice then it feels like looking into a mirror.

Some details are dated and only applies to Americans in the 1990s, but the general logic of the book can be extended to all era and all geographical regions.

### The author:

> **Paul Fussell,** critic, essayist, and cultural commentator, has recently won the H. L. Mencken Award of the Free Press Association. Among his books are *The Great War and Modem Memory,* which in 1976 won both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the National Book Award; *Abroad: British Literary Traveling Between the Wars; Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War;* and, most recently, *BAD or, The Dumbing of America.* His essays have been collected in *The Boy Scout Handbook and Other Observations* and *Thank God for the Atom Bomb and Other Essays.* He lives in Philadelphia, where he teaches English at the University of Pennsylvania.

Oh, and now Amazon has a AI-summarize customer function:
