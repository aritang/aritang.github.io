A good place to begin—how ***modern*** Google search works:

Mission of Google's search: **"organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"** — like an advanced yellowbook. Google declared their mission in [Our approach to Search](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/our-approach/), including 6 key aspects:

> (1) Deliver the most relevant and reliable information available. 
>
> (2) Maximize access to information 
>
> (3) Present information in the most useful way 
>
> (4) Protect your privacy 
>
> (5) Sell ads, nothing more
>
> (6) Help creators succeed online.

Many years ago it was PageRank. Nowadays,

- *Googlebots **crawl** the web and find out what pages exist. See [Crawling by Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/how-search-works#crawling).*
- *Google analyze the pages' content and collect **signals** about the pages. This step is called [Indexing, as defined and explained by Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/how-search-works#indexing)*
- *When a user enters a query, Google serves search results: by searching the index for matching pages and return the results based on **relevancy** and **quality**.*

Additionally Google's Ads' are also served based on their quality (not merely the amount of money the advertiser is willing to offer). Google charge on **Click-Throughs**, hence they want to maximize click-throughs of ads instead of impressions. And click-throughs are associated with Ad's quality. Somewhat this is aligned with its organic search's mission.
