I'm currently quite hooked on Mariah Carey these days. 

For those not familiar with her, she's the voice behind "All I Want for Christmas Is You." Mariah skyrocketed to fame in the early '90s with her self-titled debut album, and her early career was defined by her extraordinary vocal prowess. Her runs, riffs, and live performances during that era set a standard that remains untouched, making it an almost impossible feat for young singers to surpass.

In short, she's arguably the most technically proficient pop vocalist ever.

Today's pop music, in my view, often lacks the musical intricacy of the past. The melodies are straightforward and predictable, although the beats can be catchy. Production sometimes seems to prioritize innovation over crafting a cohesive, listenable song. The lyrics often fall short, particularly in the realm of rap. Personally, I struggle to appreciate the aesthetic of artists like Ice Spice, despite their popularity. However, Doja Cat's recent album's lead single, "Attention," stands out as a brilliant track due to the vocalist's excellent rap and the refreshing production.

In summary, contemporary pop music seems to lack a certain level of artistic maturity. It's as if the artists and producers today haven't received the same rigorous musical training. Simple chord progressions, unchanging beat combinations, and a lack of unique musical design are common. Perhaps, in this era, popular music focuses more on delivering a specific emotional experience rather than pure musical enjoyment. That's fine.

However, Mariah Carey offers something different. I won't pretend that she exists outside of the capitalist music industry bubble. That's impossible. But she has lived her life as a magnificent artistic creation, singing with the voice of an angel and mastering the most challenging vocal techniques. Her song "Hero" has two remarkable live versions, one of which was performed in 1993. The live recording was later adapted to create the official music video for the song.

Just a little bit more about the song. *Hero* is an Andante, the pace is like someone talking to you gently that you yourself is your own hero - "that the hero lies in you". The first two verses are good. Til the bridge, the Mariah started to build up tension and energy and until it proceeds to the ultimate climactic. 

Mariah Carey is more expressive in her live performances. She sang extra decorating high notes and utilize advanced vocal techniques to enrich the performance. Well, that's what you aim for in a 90s diva's live performance, instead of some off-pitch shits on YT today.

Two other outstanding live performances include:

In the later two performances, she hits a dazzling G5 note. I can't help but listen to the song repeatedly because of her rich runs and riffs. Every time you listen, you discover something new, and her incredible vocal ability never ceases to amaze. She's almost otherworldly.
