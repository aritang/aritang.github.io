**Here's an embark on a special holiday series - a review of "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" (MMM), a show that has captivated me recently.**

For those unfamiliar, ***The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel*** is a period comedy-drama television series set in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It stars Rachel Brosnahan as Miriam "Midge" Maisel, a New York housewife who discovers her knack for stand-up comedy and embarks on a journey to build a career in it. The show's fifth and final season premiered and concluded in May 2023 on Amazon Prime Videos.

I reserved MMM for my winter holiday, creating the perfect viewing environment: curtains drawn, room darkened, a stark contrast to watching some other shows on a gym treadmill (miserable...). This setting brought back high school memories and highlighted the growth of both myself and the characters over the years. It was a magical experience to see how much more I could understand and appreciate in the series compared to my initial viewing.

Here are three standout aspects of MMM that underscore its brilliance and serve as persuasive points for its must-watch status.

### The Fashionista's Dream: Costume Design

The wardrobe of Midge Maisel is nothing short of fabulous, reminiscent of a nostalgic "Mean Girls" (2004), where characters wear their clothes rather than being overshadowed by them. Midge's ever-changing outfits are a testament to the show's attention to detail and dedication to period authenticity. In a delightful nod to this wardrobe feat, season five, episode two humorously acknowledges the sheer volume of costumes acquired.

{{<figure align="center" src="/tattooed_heart/sell_them_all.png" caption="S5E02. The then-famous Midge announced that she will auction all her clothes for charity, walking down a long isle to cutely addressing the maximalism of her wardrobe.">}}

Donna Zakowska, the two-time Emmy award-winning costume designer, masterfully uses color to reflect Midge's emotional journey, likening her coats to "multi-colored armor" or a superhero's cape, empowering her as she navigates her comedy career.

> “I used color to depict [Midge’s] emotional landscape and give emphasis to moments in which she needed to be particularly comic or heroic or even proactive,” Zakowska wrote in her book *[Madly Marvelous: The Costumes of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.](https://www.amazon.com/Madly-Marvelous-Costumes-Mrs-Maisel/dp/1419744410/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=madly+marvelous+the+costumes+of+the+marvelous+mrs.+maisel&qid=1642306580&sprefix=madly+marv%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-1)* “I started to refer to her coats as ‘multi-colored armor.' I considered [them] to be the equivalent of a superhero cape—transfiguring, protective, emotional armor that emboldens and empowers her as a character.”

### Nostalgic Escapism

MMM's early seasons are a masterclass in escapism, with the Catskills episode (season 2, episode 4) being a prime example. The Weissman family's annual summer trip to Steiner's Resort in the Catskill Mountains is depicted with such artistry and nostalgia for the 1950s that it leaves a lasting impact on the viewer's aesthetic sensibilities. This episode, a dreamy kaleidoscope of pastel colors and leisurely summer activities, effortlessly transports viewers to a bygone era.

See this [clip](https://youtu.be/WWG46NuUYz0?si=u62NjTy6RFdtWWco) for a glimpse. Spoiler alert, the "chicken fat" bgm really stunned me for how groundbreakingly it suits the scene and everything.

### Narrative Depth

The introduction of flashbacks in season five has been met with mixed reviews, but I argue it elevates MMM to new heights, making it one of Amazon's most ambitious series. Through Midge's trials and tribulations in the cutthroat show business, the series reveals the harsh realities behind the glamour.

It breaks the bubble to the stark reality. From being dropped by Shy Baldwin to toiling as a writer on Gordon Ford's show, Midge's journey from a betrayed housewife to a rising comedy star is fraught with challenges, underscoring the resilience and tenacity required to succeed.

### Anyway

To conclude, words barely scratch the surface of "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's" splendor. This series is a testament to the power of storytelling, costume design, and character development, wrapped in a package of humor and historical reflection. I cannot recommend it enough. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
