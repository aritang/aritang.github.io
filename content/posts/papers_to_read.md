I love working. I get a day off and I'm confused. I'm like, cause I'll have to do something?

But sometimes being too occupied drowns oneself. I will find myself staring at the computer screen with something displaying yet my mind simply does not work. The delicate balance of being active and burnt out is something that shall not be taken for granted.

Already feeling losing a bit of control over life, here's some minimal effort of taking it back––the list of to-read papers and priorities that should be on the top of my mind.

### theories

I've had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with professor Guillermo Gallego from CUHK-SZ during the 2024 Mostly OM conference. Indeed, as its name playfully termed, our conversation revolves around almost everything but operational management.

### information design in OM

The past decades wraps up information design studied in theoretical economics and algorithmic game theory. But it is the dawning of this elegant and powerful methodology in management science. There's a booming activity in the OM community to do information design–on real issues.

It's exciting. I'm smelling some Nobel Prices already.

> TOREAD: briefly, about two papers *somebody* sent me, about information design in OM.

### online linear programming

Multiplicative weight updates, online resource allocation, dual shadow prices, Whittle's index policy derived from its Lagrangian relaxation––I feel like these are connected. Maybe it will happen someday later that I'd like to somehow summarize a uniform framework in viewing these seemingly uncorrealated topics.

> Start with: a talk I'd listended to during ITCS workshop 2024, about Online Linear Programming. 
>
> Two previous papers discussed with professor Yinyu Ye.

### antitrust

> Chapter 9 **Antitrust in the New Economy**. *Economics of Regulation and Antitrust fifth edition*. (2018).

And more... It's interesting to keep in track of the to-do reading materials' dynamics–to see how the list grow and shrink. They're like nutritions––I'd need them on a regular, healthy basis to keep my brain fresh.
