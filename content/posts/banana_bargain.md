There's a carnival of groceries at the heart of the town, lively, a bit chaotic, and full of fruit stands. Each one offers a variety of fruits that seem similar but are unique in their quality and price.

I was looking for a specific local banana🍌, known for being budget-friendly yet deliciously sweet when ripe. I wandered from stall to stall, asking for it, but had no luck. The vendors kept steering me towards a different type of banana, claiming it was better – but it just wasn't what I wanted.

Finally, tucked away in a corner, I spotted my prize. A bunch of the perfect bananas hung there, looking fresh and inviting. The price wasn't listed, so I asked the owner. He paused, giving me a quick once-over, and then quoted ¥3 per 500g – a steep jump from the usual ¥1.

I could tell he was sizing me up, guessing how much I'd be willing to pay based on my untimely outfit featuring a fancy coat and set of headphones, which does not fit at all into the market vibe then. He thought he could get away with tripling the price. 

But I wasn't going to fall for that. In a loud voice, just enough for others to hear, I exclaimed, "That's way too expensive! The stand over there is selling them for ¥1..."

And then, the owner threw the ball back in my court, saying,

> "You name the price. What do you think is fair?"

This caught me off guard. I wanted to pay as little as possible, but I also didn't want to seem cheap. The bargain played out in those fleeting moments was actually pretty intense. To name a price that honored both my savvy and my self-respect, in such short moment I got stuck - and offered ¥2.5 and ended up buying the bananas🍌.

My bid was for sure sub-optimal, worse, far from no-regret. The bananas have been hovering around my mind all day - I should have done better, the owner's real bottom line was probably closer to ¥1.6 🤯
