summary: The aesthetic is awesome and clever as Ariana Grande always was. The vocal is... acceptable but not as good as her Sweetener era.

Ariana Grande has been absent from the music scene for quite some time, at least in terms of releasing new music to the public. Currently, she is engrossed in her cosmetic product line and the production of the Wicked movie. Her most recent album, *Positions*, harkens back to 2020, and her latest musical offering was the collaborative remix *Die For You* with The Weeknd. However, I must admit that it doesn't quite measure up to their earlier joint venture, *Save Your Tears*. It appears that the artists might be attempting to replicate their prior success, yet this endeavor seems to fall short, revealing the discerning nature of Arianators, her dedicated fan base.

Finally, the moment we've all been waiting for has arrived.

In celebration of the tenth anniversary of Ariana Grande's debut album, *Yours Truly*, she is gracing us with live performances of those beloved songs once again. The tracklist boasts nostalgic anthems for early Arianators, including "Honeymoon Avenue," her breakthrough hit "The Way (feat. Mac Miller)," and the treasured favorite "Tattooed Heart."

Dubbed as a "live" event, the Tenth Anniversary Yours Truly Live Performance is, in fact, a meticulously recorded and heavily edited video series. Intriguingly, Ariana Grande herself offers a glimpse into the authentic recording setting – exposed wires and an array of cameras capturing every angle. The video editing, however, leaves room for confusion, with noticeable transitions between different recording sessions, dispelling any notion of a continuous, single take. And lastly, while Ariana Grande's affinity for post-production tools is evident, the "live" performance's audio bears traces of imperfection, including occasional off-key moments and less-than-smooth vocal runs. One might wonder, did she stumble, or is this a deliberate act?

For evidence, see how the camera tray disappears within less than 1/24 second in the video:

Particularly focusing on the song "Tattooed Heart," it's worth noting that Ariana Grande penned this beautiful doo-wop ballad at the tender age of 17, releasing it in September 2013. Characterized by delicate, dreamy backup vocal harmonies, the track poses an astonishing vocal challenge. Delving into its performance history, a curated selection of live renditions of "Tattooed Heart" is readily accessible online, presented chronologically:

- [1] [Ariana Grande's Performance at the American Music Awards (2013)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al1k1Wq3pSQ) showcases a raw and unpolished Ariana Grande rendition. She presumably performed live without the safety net of autotune, and was screaming her lung out to hit those high notes.

- [2] [iHeartRadio Pre-Halloween Concert Performance (2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-uUieI7ipg) captures Ariana Grande during her early Dangerous Woman era, displaying the pinnacle of her vocal prowess. This rendition mirrors the studio version's intricate techniques, delivered with a more mature and poised vocal approach.

- [3] [Sweetener World Tour Charlotte - Birthday Dedication to Mom Special Edition (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLoPyIOFJmA) stands out as the apex among the "Tattooed Heart" performances, characterized by exceptional vocal control. Noteworthy is the artistic finesse with which Ariana treats each syllable, allowing words, melodies, and crescendos to gracefully intertwine.

- [4] [k bye for now (Sweetener World Tour live performance official released recording) (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHY5gftyO2A) is quintessentially Ariana Grande. Although fan-recorded versions from the Sweetener World Tour exhibit superior renditions, this official release incorporates vocal editing and splicing that puzzle even the most devoted fans.

    But the atmosphere setting and stage lighting design is oh-my-god-ly insane. At the live performance in London, Ariana stood beneath the moon, delivering a grand and romantic performance that nearly surpassed the studio recording version.

- [5] [Yours Truly Tenth Anniversary (Live from London) (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaZXwYjal8E) represents the most recent 10th-anniversary performance. Her vocals show signs of fatigue, and the artistic finesse, evident in prior performances, appears somewhat diminished. Regrettably, it is disappointing. But the aesthetic is excellent as usual.

Ariana Grande's journey through live performances of "Tattooed Heart" presents a dynamic evolution, highlighting the challenges, growth, and occasional missteps that accompany a vocalist's artistic exploration. 

My personal favourite was and will forever be her sweetener era's rendition. Strongly recommend the [mom's-birthday version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPZdb8NzCu8), it's my serotonin boost. Go and listen please!
