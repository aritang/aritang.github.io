I've been working on my machine learning final project. My friend and I built ***SHERLOCK*** - a detector for LLM-generated code, targeted at beginner level programming course assignment.

Choice matters. I felt so lucky that my teacher told me this exiting topic so that we can work on such interesting a problem (other than some lame and clich√© ML projects). But I've also been obsessively perfecting the project report hence spending way too much time on it than I should have been. It's sweet and fun, but I also gotta wrap it up swiftly and get on to... the next final project.

Will write about a bit more detail about it in the future. Like, why not?
