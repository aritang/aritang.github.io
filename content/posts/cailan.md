I caught an interesting bookz-roughly translated as *Lam Chua's weibo Sharp Comments*.

Chua Lam, alongside Jin Yong, Ni Kuang, and Wong Jim, is renowned as one of the 'Four Great Talents' of Hong Kong. He is also a celebrated filmmaker, author, and gourmet. Chua has a playful, iconic blend of amusement and innocence that effortlessly wields with perfect balance of playfulness and perceptiveness–an attitude that inspires and amazes his readers.

Chua loves Weibo (the Chinese twitter) and, instead of just using it as a announcement tool:

> Talking to oneself is the dullest affair. It's far better if you ask and I respond—now that's interaction! Plus, it fits perfectly with the succinct spirit of Weibo.

The book essentially recorded Chua's answers to questions posed by people online–topics varies among life, food, and most prevalent, about love and relationships.

> : What motivates you to reply to every comment on Weibo? Where's the fun in that?
>
> : Sharing the fun and learning from it.

> : I'm only 25 this year, but my family is already pushing me to get married, and I haven't even started my career yet. What should I do?
>
> : No need to follow suit.

> : Isn't it often the case that women fall deeper into ambiguous relationships while men withdraw quicker?
>
> : What era are you living in? Women aren't as helpless as you think.

> : If it were you, would you engage in something that leads nowhere?
>
> : I often do.

> : Do people grow more nostalgic for familial love and drift away from romantic love as they age?
>
> : Many women end up eating with their parents due to heartbreak.

> : Today, a friend's capriciousness really got to me. Mr. Chua, how should one handle a friend's whims properly?
>
> : Scold them!
>
> : Haha, I can't bring myself to do that, she's a girl.
>
> : Then what are you complaining about? Enjoy your troubles...
