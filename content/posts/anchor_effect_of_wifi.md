Some fun observations when I was opening up Wi-Fi service at my apartment.

The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption states that, adding or removing an extra option (an “irrelevant alternative”) should not change the relative preference between existing options.

Xfinity's marketing team strongly disagrees:

The \$45 plan is dominated by the \$40 plan. But according to the representative at the store, >>90% choose the \$40 plan. How much of these are thanks to the *stupid* \$45 plan just being in the middle? 

Perhaps, well, thatthe \$45 plan is the most 'valuable' one here...
