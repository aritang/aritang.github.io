Our former Prime Minister, Keqiang Li, has passed away in Shanghai today. Rest in peace.

Li, an economist, earned his Ph.D. from Peking University and received the Sun Ye Fang Best Thesis Award for his dissertation – quite an achievement. In memory of this exceptional economist and remarkable individual, here's a poignant tribute:

> 纯真而不欠闻达，善良而不失坚强，把生命高举在尘俗之上，又溶化于社会之中，这应当是我们这一代的共同追求。
>
> Innocent yet not lacking in knowledge, kind yet unwavering in strength, lifting life above the mundane while melding with society – this should be the collective pursuit of our generation.
>
> Li, Jan. 10, 1982.
