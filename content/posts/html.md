Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code is the foundational language for creating and structuring content on the web. It defines and presents elements, like headings, paragraphs, images, etc. When one enters a URL or open an HTML file in a web browser, the browser processes the HTML code, applies CSS for styling, and executes any JavaScript. This results in a visual representation of the web page that one can see and interact with.

Many blog platforms, or in general, content management platforms allows the use of HTML for fine-tuning the appearance and functionality of pages. For example

- **Markdown with HTML:** In platforms that support Markdown (like GitHub, Jekyll, and some blogging tools), HTML can be used alongside Markdown to add more complex elements or styles.

    For example, HTML code is often used to embed external content or create custom widgets, like adding video content from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.

- **Direct HTML:** Some platforms allow direct HTML input to customize the layout or add specific features that Markdown alone can't achieve.

Moreover, HTML is used in designing visually rich **emails** with images, links, and styled text. 

Rendering is essential, carried out by Web Browsersr or markdown editors, or email clients, to transform raw HTML code into a visual and interactive format that users can engage with.
