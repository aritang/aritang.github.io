### Why Ballet?

Maybe it comes down to personal taste—I’d say most girls and women, at some point in their lives, fall in love with ballet for its captivating femininity and artistry. But beyond that, ballet is a great way to invest your time—whether through practice, watching live performances in a theater, or even just playing YouTube videos in the background while doing laundry.

Because ballet is both art and fun. It originated in Italian Renaissance in the 15th century, and developed into structured art by the passionate dancer **King Louis XIV of France** through establishing the **Académie Royale de Danse in 1661**. This marked the beginning of ballet as a formalized discipline with codified techniques and positions. 

Over time, ballet evolved into the professional performance art we know today, spreading across Europ, then America, and eventually all the world. With its global presence, you can find a reputable ballet company in almost every major city, and there’s no shortage of online resources to explore.

But what makes ballet even more fascinating is how it compares to its artistic counterparts. Unlike opera, where performers mostly stand and sing, or symphonies that demand full concentration, ballet is visually engaging, fast-paced, and far from dull. It’s designed for entertainment—you can even applaud and cheer during the performance! (note: technically you can cheer during opera intervals too.)

Anyway, here are some selected ballet excerpts I’ve written about. The list will continue to grow, and I hope you enjoy them!
