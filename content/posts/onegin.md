I have Tchaikovsky's ***Polonaise*** from *Eugene Onegin* (Op. 24) on repeat in my playlist. Since it’s such a grand waltz, I decided to look up its corresponding ballet choreography—only to end up watching the entire *Eugene Onegin* ballet **without ever hearing the piece**. Here’s why the *Polonaise* isn’t featured in the *Onegin* ballet.

### A Breakdown of Onegin's Different Versions

#### Novel and Opera

***Eugene Onegin*** (also spelled *Yevgeniy Onegin*) is a novel in verse by Alexander Pushkin. The plot is simple: Onegin, a detached aristocrat, rejects the love of a sincere country girl, Tatyana, only to later fall in love with her when it’s too late. It is highly regarded in Russian literature not only because it's a melancholic love story but for its philosophical depth and introduction of the key **literary archetypes**—notably, Onegin as the "superfluous man." Pushkin’s sharp, ironic writing is also a major reason for its high status.

In 1879, Tchaikovsky adapted the novel (1833) into an **opera**, premiering ***Eugene Onegin (Op. 24)***. Fun fact: When the opera was performed in Hamburg in 1892, Gustav Mahler conducted, while Tchaikovsky himself sat in the audience.

#### Ballet Version

And there is a **ballet version** of *Eugene Onegin*, often just called *Onegin*, debuted by the Stuttgart Ballet in 1965. It **doesn’t** use Tchaikovsky’s *Eugene Onegin* opera music, but uses a different selection of lesser-known Tchaikovsky’s compositions, mainly from his piano works and orchestral pieces. Since the ballet relies entirely on movement, its emotional conflicts feel even more intense, expressed through dance rather than words or music from the opera.

### Which Version to Choose?

- If you want Pushkin’s wit, irony, and philosophical depth, go for the novel.
- If you want direct, emotionally charged storytelling, go for the opera.
- If you want pure movement and visual storytelling, go for the ballet.

Each version brings something unique, but now you know why Tchaikovsky’s *Polonaise* isn’t in the *Onegin* ballet! **That said, since the piece is ridiculously popular, it often shows up as an encore (or that grand second-to-last piece) in concert programs. You’ll probably hear it as an encore in concert programs—or squeezed into an opera gala if you’re lucky.**
