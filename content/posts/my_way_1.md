I am back in Stanford, to do research with professor Modibo Camara in the Stanford Graduate School of Business while taking a few interesting classes. Some of my friends stayed in the Bay area. Got together to have coffee or dinner and talk with them–it's interesting to see how our state of minds evolve over time. 

Some things never change though. Coincidentally, two of the friends recommended me two piece of music. Here they are:

> **My Way**, song by *Frank Sinatra*, listen to it [here on YouTube](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=qQzdAsjWGPg&si=DqnZcoM71CJKbq4H&feature=xapp_share)

He said, focus, specifically on the lyrics:

> Regrets, I've had a few. But then again, too few to mention
>
> I did what I had to do. And saw it through without exemption.
>
> I planned each charted course. Each careful step along the byway
>
> And more, much more than this, I did it my way

It will definitely feel very fortunate is someone is to look back on his or her trajectory and claim that, "I've pretty much have had no regret". 

I'm a person who don't regret much, but not because that I can claim to have made the exactly optimal choices, but because it's simply not rational to regret on the past–some thing that is out of control.

Think economically, sink costs!
