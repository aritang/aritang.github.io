We will focus on Google Chrome to discuss 3rd party cookies' value in online advertising. Because (i) Cookie and privacy policies vary among **browsers**, and Chrome is the most popular web-browser (91.56% global share, according 6sense's [report](https://6sense.com/tech/ad-exchange/google-doubleclick-market-share)) (ii) Google announced their plan in replacing 3rd party cookies in 2025 (iii) The ***Ad-exchange industry***, whose value largely depends on Cookies, accounts for 10% of Google's revenue.

### The Ad-Exchange Industry Structure

Publishers like the NY Times attract readers and sell ad space to third-party ad exchanges, which collect user information through cookies and sell it to advertisers. This ecosystem facilitates targeted advertising and effective ad placements.

### Benefits of Third-Party Cookies

- **Targeting**: Allows behavioral targeting and effective ad management.
- **Measurement**: Helps in measuring ad effectiveness and cross-site attribution, so as to facilitate bidding.
- **Automation and Scale**: Supports ad campaign optimization and large-scale deployment.

Advertisers benefit from cookies by reaching targeted consumers more effectively, measuring ad interactions, and leveraging identity-based information to refine ad strategies.

### The Privacy Dilemma

Advertisers have a long wish list, where they aspire to increase the value of their ads, but possibly through sacrifice privacy:

- reach large quantities, targeted consumers
- masure basic information necessary for ads: clicks, conversions
- preferably, some more identity-based info: user behavior, identity across sites
- run experiments and automation

***The Dilemma***: Informativeness erodes privacy but makes ads more valuable. Cookies provides informativeness and can achieve all these tasks.
