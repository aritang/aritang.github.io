The song casts a magical spell. The first line of the chorus, with the lyric ***'the boy is mine'***, masterfully escalates the tension built up from the pre-chorus––however though, by disrupting the tension's anticipating flow, with a striking and beautiful ***fermata*** on the tempo. This innovative technique, rarely seen in recent pop productions, perfectly ignites the song’s whimsical and provocative allure.

The visual treatment enhances the song's theme of possessive love, adding layers of complexity to the narrative depth and intepretation for the song's expression.
