The song is magical. The highlight is, the first line of the Chorus, with the lyrics singing ***'the boy is mine'***, is abusively built on the tension aggregated from the pre-chorus. But it breaks the tension, or at least the expected continuity, by a wild, beautiful fermata on the tempo. This innovative technique (at least not be seen in recent pop productions) ignites the whole song's capricious, nasty sexiness.
