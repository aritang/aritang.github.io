Imagine you're analyzing a group of general undergraduates taking math classes. Some are social science majors who might be taking introductory statistics, while others are engineering majors taking advanced calculus. You need some index to measure the average difficulty level of the math classes taken by all these students, say, Stats101 for 1pt while Real Analysis gets 10pt and we'll take arithmetic mean as the difficulty score representing the general course level taken by all the students. In a hospital setting, patients would have different conditions that require different levels of care, resources, and expenses. The **Case Mix Index (CMI)** is a numerical value that represents the average severity and complexity of patients' conditions treated in a hospital or a specific department. A higher CMI indicates more complex and resource-intensive cases.

As for **Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG)**, think of it as a way to categorize these students based on the math courses they are taking. Each course (or group of similar courses) is like a DRG, and it has a certain weight assigned to it based on its difficulty and the resources needed to teach it. In the hospital context, DRGs classify patients based on their medical conditions and treatments, and each DRG has a weight that reflects the average resources required to treat patients in that group. This system helps determine how much hospitals get paid for treating patients, ensuring that payments are aligned with the complexity of the care provided.

Mathematically, CMI is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of all patients' **DRGs**. CMI accounts for the complexity and severity of patients' conditions, providing a more nuanced, quantifiable view of a hospital's patient population, compared to other raw metrics like the number of patients or procedures, not to mention–revenue. A higher CMI (≥1.5) often indicates that a hospital is using more resources per patient, which can be a sign of providing more specialized or intensive care. It also helps hospitals to better understand their financial performance and, is closely tied to reimbursement rates under systems like Medicare's DRG-based payments.

Despite being quite a useful, widely admitted and comprehensive metric, setting CMI as the major  component of hospital's evaluation would cause problems. It does not align perfectly with the overall objective of medical system: CMI primarily focus on the complexity of cases, but not necessarily the quality of care or patient outcomes. It can be misleading and biased because a hospital specializing in treating complex cases might be naturally advantageous in CMI in the first place. Even worse, CMI is pretty susceptible to gaming: there can be an incentive for hospitals to upcode or document diagnoses in a way that artificially inflates their CMI, or even reducing the number of beds so as to boost the number by lowering the divisor.

And we don't even need an environment to verify the preceding points. It's already out there in the news. Stayed tuned for the next episode of this series.
