Some people seem to be taking my kindness and authenticity for granted, and one of them was extremely mean to me today. Today's blog is a reminder that words can carry immense power that can hurt people straight to their soul and even shake one's beliefs. It also flagged out a kind of persona I would avoid becoming.

Fortunately, I still have a bunch of friends to call immediately, who rushed to me and escorted me out for a lovely night of trashing all the nonsense from people we'd met recently. Keep moving, like, what's next?
