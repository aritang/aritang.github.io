Lately, I’ve been revisiting *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. There’s one particular quote in the movie that resonates deeply:

> Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light

Really, Professor Dumbledore reminds me of another professor I happen to know—sharp wit, tender humor, infinite patience, and a bit of mystery (in the best way). I won’t tell you who that is, but you can find us together in the [About Me](/about/) page.
