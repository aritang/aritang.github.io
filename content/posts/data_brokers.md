Data (e.g. data sets, data streams and data services) are collected and sold by data brokers, via data exchange platforms (the marketplace). [Data Commerce Cloud](https://www.datacommercecloud.com/) (a 'data monetization' platform for data suppliers) listed a directory of data marketplaces. A data marketplace can be operated by companies (e.g. professional data marketplace business), government agencies (e.g. Shanghai data exchange), or third-party providers (Amazon and Google).

The global market for data is valued [USD 968 million](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-marketplace-market-report) in 2022. Key players (top 10) includes:

1. [Datarade](https://datarade.ai/)

## data sellers on  data marketplaces

Data sellers collect and complie data to build data products. For example, a data broker campany would obtain 1st party data from publishers and complie them to build consumer profiles on hundreds of millions of consumers. Overall, data products can include static datasets, databases or real-time data streams delivered via API.

The data sellers then list their data product on data marketplaces. Nowadays, service-side software provider platforms offer integration service (aka data monetizing) to allow data sellers to manage their data product with one account (instead of managing accounts on several, disconnected data marketplaces).

Data providers operates highly decentralized and area-special.

## buying data

Data are available for purchase in various formats:

- `one-off purchase`: buy data access for a single, specific dataset or report without any commitment to future purchases.
- `periodic licence`: subscribe to access a particular dataset or series of datasets on a monthly basis (especially, when the data provider streams new data periodically)
- `user-based`: charges based on the amount of data one use (i.e. the number of data calls, the volume of data download, or some other metric of usage).

Data are available in almost all areas:

{{<figure align="center" src="/data_vis/data_available.jpeg" caption="Almost about everything can be bought via these data marketplaces (e.g. [Datarade](https://datarade.ai/data-categories)).">}}

Mostly data is stored in some cloud database, and purchased data access is facilitated by the data exchange marketplace. The way of data sold is worthing mentioning: some small data products have posted prices, and are instantly purchasable, where payment and transaction for these products is processed directly over the marketplace. However, for larger ticket data purchases, prices are not necessarily transparent, and the nagotiation moves away from the data marketplace and involves more delicate bargaining between the seller and buyer.
