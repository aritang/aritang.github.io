Not time to look thoroughly into Google's issue yet. However, one of Google's main arguments:

> With the cost of ads going down and the number of ads sold going up, the market is working. The DOJ’s case risks inefficiencies and higher prices — the last thing that America’s economy or our small businesses need right now.

Sounds more like a threat than a proper defense. To me it's less compelling than DOJ's 170-page complaints. But I do believe that Google has put forward irreplaceable technologies to have significantly advanced the ad tech industry. But one might live a double life, isn't it.
