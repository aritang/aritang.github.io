I was at the opening night of ***Cosi Fan Tutte by the LA Opera***, March 07 2025 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion theater:

> Pro Tips for classical performances, especially grand productions like Ballet and Opera:
>
> - Arrive early (1 hour+) to attend pre-show lectures, explore the venue, take a glass of wine, or just chill in the bathroom.
> - Read the synopsis on the handouts. It's generally a good idea to read the plot before attending an opera or ballet. Operas are often performed in languages other than English, while ballets don't even have language. It can be challenging to follow every detail of the story while also appreciating the music and staging.

The title *"Così fan tutte"* is Italian for *"Thus do all women"*, often interpreted as *"All women are like that."* The opera, composed by **Mozart** with a libretto by **Lorenzo Da Ponte**, is a comedic yet thought-provoking exploration of love, fidelity, and human nature. It tells the story of two young soldiers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, who make a bet with the cynical philosopher Don Alfonso that their fiancées, Dorabella and Fiordiligi, will remain faithful to them. To test their lovers, the men pretend to go off to war, only to return in disguise and attempt to seduce each other’s fiancée.

At first, the women resist, but under the influence of their mischievous maid, Despina, and Don Alfonso’s manipulations, they eventually succumb. The deception escalates to a mock wedding before the truth is revealed, leaving all four lovers humiliated and uncertain about their relationships. The opera ends ambiguously—some productions suggest reconciliation, while others highlight the damage caused by the test. With its mix of comedy, emotional depth, and beautiful ensemble music, *Così fan tutte* is both an entertaining and philosophical take on love and human weakness.

The LA Opera's production is amazing with a (relatively) modern stage setting in the 1930s.

Last but now least, go for front row seats if possible. If seated at the "top of the mountain" with the cheapest student ticket, it would be hard to see literally anything...
