Whenever one downloads a new app on an iPhone, a system notification pops up, inquiring if one wish to permit cross-application tracking. Apple has long championed this feature, underscoring their commitment to user privacy. Apple's marketing not only highlights Apple's dedication to privacy but also subtly positions their products as trustworthy guardians of personal data.

However, I've also read about (although not taking their opinions seriously cause I had been a stan of Apple by then) some critics pointing to a nuanced concern. They argue that while this approach seemingly safeguards user privacy in the short term, it potentially seeds future monopolistic issues. As Apple's market share expands, they become the sole custodians of vast amounts of personal information. The fear is that this data, initially collected under the guise of protection, would eventually be leveraged for advertising purposes.

I didn't understand this quite much until now that I'm actually IN the industry, grappling with concepts like match value, sponsored search, and recommendation systems blahblahblah - that I fully grasped the magnitude of this issue. Apple, now an undisputed market leader, holds an almost intimidating sway over consumer privacy data, **almost like a gatekeeper to the pandora box**. This data has become a coveted asset, sought after by companies, platforms, and  even consumers alike. Each party not only desires to control or utilize this information but also wishes to restrict others from accessing it.

And so, the prophecy appears to be fulfilling itself: Apple's primary use of this data is evolving towards advertisement. As an old Chinese saying goes, "圖窮匕見" - the dagger is not revealed until the map is fully unrolled. It's time.
