summary: About the 2023 Econ Nobel, how it relates with Barbie, and the controversy about Lisa's recent dance performance.
---

The 2023 Econ Nobel has finally arrived! I'm curious of the timeline design, why that they unveiled all the other prizes from October 2nd to 6th and then pause, made us wait for three days for our favorite one until Oct. 9? Perhaps someone wants to play hard-to-get for the world's attention, or maybe there are some procrastinators on the committee who took forever to decide the laureate.

Just...kidding. Congratulations to the amazing Claudia Godin! As a woman myself, I'm incredibly proud to have her representing active female economists in the field.

Her research focuses on gender equality. Fantastic! It feels like the summer's Barbie frenzy has stepped into autumn. From young people's pop culture to serious academic discussions, it's now acknowledged with the highest honor in the field. We have Oscar-winning Margot Robbie and Nobel-winning Professor Godin speaking out about the history of gender inequality and how we can improve the situation. Does anyone have any opinions on this matter? Mute.

Btw, there's been a lot of debate recently about the decency of Lisa's bold stripper dance performance. Is it art, freedom, or just another way of objectifying women? Personally, I support Lisa and admire her courage and dedication. Most of the criticism regarding her performance seems to come from her most loyal fans who projected their own desired image onto her and must be quite frustrated when she broke away from it. Sorry, it can be harsh.

However, from another point of view regarding to this wave of voices, it's important to realize the fact that the public is discussing it, in a serious manner within the context of feminism, sexual freedom, and women's rights. People care and are paying attention, that's all that matters. Cause as Doja Cat sings in her new song *Attention*

> But ain't the bad press good?
