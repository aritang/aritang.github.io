What an elegant name! It reminded me of the book *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*. 

> Mostly OM is an annual international workshop sponsored by the School of Economics and Management, the Research Center for Contemporary Management, of Tsinghua University, focusing on the state-of-the-art research in Operations Management (OM), broadly defined. Mostly OM aims to provide a forum for researchers, from China and overseas alike, to foster interaction and exchange ideas, learn from each other new methodologies and applications, and explore opportunities for collaboration.

I was very lucky that my advisor sponsored me to attend this workshop––a wonderful opportunity to learn from the frontier and world-class speakers. The upcoming schedule is amazing, and I will update them later, so as to keep track of the talks I've listened to.
