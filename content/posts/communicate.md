Ever stumbled upon a track that plays like a secret everyone knows but no one talks about? Well, Ariana Grande's unreleased single "Communicate" fits that bill perfectly. It's an intriguing piece about the dance of words and silences that happens right before a relationship officially starts. And here's the kicker—it's somehow popped up officially on platforms like Apple Music and Spotify, but not under Ariana's name. Instead, it's credited to "Who Do We Blame." Curious, isn't it?

{{<figure align="center" src="/who_do_we_blame/communicate.jpeg" caption="Not listed under Ariana Grande's name—but 'Who Do We Blame.' Take a listen to the [final version](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/arianagrande/images/b/b8/Communicate_Abm_150_1.29.20_1-2.mp3/revision/latest?cb=20240220175055), or if you prefer, the [acapella](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/arianagrande/images/b/b8/Communicate_Abm_150_1.29.20_1-2.mp3/revision/latest?cb=20240220175055) version.">}}

The lyrics really resonate, painting a vivid picture of the modern dating scene:

> The buzz in my pocket (Yuh)
>
> My heart sayin' "bitch stop it" (Yuh)
>
> Just play it cool, be honest (Yuh)
>
> Just let him know, babe (Baby)

There's even a [less-edited version on YouTube](https://youtu.be/irE9Gc_hTCQ?si=B0RoflMc9FXCRdFS) that lets you catch the raw essence of Ari's vocals—flaws and all, unpolished like a diamond before the cut. It’s a real treat for those who love peeling back the layers of a track to hear the core.

Though it seems this song will never grace an official album due to its leaky route to our playlists, it opens up a can of worms about leaks, copyright laws, and the chaos they can cause. But that’s a story for another day. For now, it's time to plug in your headphones and let "Communicate" take you on a journey of whispered truths and heartfelt confessions. Goodnight, music lovers!
