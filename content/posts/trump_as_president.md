His victory was confirmed just after 5:30 a.m. Eastern when [he captured the battleground state of Wisconsin](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/06/us/trump-election-harris-news?campaign_id=190&emc=edit_ufn_20241106&instance_id=138854&nl=from-the-times&regi_id=218522180&segment_id=182405&user_id=0a8c4566bc8f710b9b7e1db980b74741#wisconsin-election-harris-trump), putting him above the threshold of 270 electoral votes.
