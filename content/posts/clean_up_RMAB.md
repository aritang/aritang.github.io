The food rescue project has officially come to an end, so I'm now looking forward to a series of joyful months leading up til graduation. I have a mix of delightful tasks ahead—tidying up both the physical and digital clutter, organizing books and papers, and even enjoying a few indulgences: concerts, ballet classes, and some long-overdue shopping.

Among the tasks on my list is a thorough clean-up of the RMAB project. Now formally titled **"Contextual Budget Bandit in Food Rescue..."**, it has many unpublished results that didn't make into the paper, interesting mathematical methods, and heaps of code that need some serious reorganization. To make an end is to make a beginning, of which this one is filled with opportunities to learn, share, and refine.

Stay tuned—more updates and reflections will follow tomorrow!
