Duanwu, also known as the Dragon Boat Festival, is a traditional Chinese holiday celebrated on the 5th day of the 5th lunar month. It commemorates Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet who lived—and died—for his country over 2,000 years ago.

But for me, Duanwu means something more personal. It marks the true beginning of summer—thick with heat, humidity, and a kind of restless energy. It's a season that feels chaotic, slightly uncomfortable, yet oddly peaceful. Everything about this festival is part of my comfort zone. The traditions. The food—especially *zongzi* (sticky rice dumplings), my all-time favorite. The heat. It all brings me back to childhood, to a place I belong. 

Guess one always returns to where you once longed for—that's not just nostalgia. That’s roots and home.

In my hometown, people really get serious with the **dragon boat race**. It's technically challenging cause the dragon boats have to navigate complicated S turns in high speed and long boat. Each village sends its team. Interestingly, the rowers are usually rich landowners (millionaires and billionaires). Each paddle spot can cost anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 RMB. Training starts months before the festival. Humor has it that if a team loses too badly, they’ll be dragged to the ancestral hall to kneel and explain themselves to the ancestors.

Check the following video for the champion team this year. The river fish are having a bad time today—being slapped in the face over and over...
