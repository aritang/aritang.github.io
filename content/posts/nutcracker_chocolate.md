A *Divertissement* (French for "entertainment" or "amusement") in ballet means one/several short dance performed as an interlude, often irrelevant to main plot but to showcase the dancers' technical abilities.

The *Nutcracker* has technically **7** divertissements:

The naming of Tchaikovsky's Dibertissements would sometimes be criticized to be racist. (Well, technically it's more of a choreography problem, where the costumes and dances included a lot of racial stereotypes). Surely the whole history of Nutcracker wasn't 100% polite or unbiased. But how the music themselves are named (e.g. Chinese Tea, Arabian Coffee) are "curious and fascinating". In my pov, nothing wrong with Tchaikovsky or the traditional name, and we should keep the tradition. It's more about the way artist/us interpret it, and it's indeed better that we're doing it with more care nowadays.

Anyway, Tchaikovsky presented the first one to be a uplifting Spanish Bolero, "The orchestra, complete with castanets, plays a spirited tune to accompany a dancer representing ***Chocolate***":
