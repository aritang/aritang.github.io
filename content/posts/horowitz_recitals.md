[Vladimir Horowitz: The Unreleased Live Recordings 1966-1983](https://music.apple.com/ng/album/vladimir-horowitz-the-unreleased-live-recordings-1966/1063391589) is an extensive collection of 50 CDs, documenting Horowitz's live performances across 17 years. This set includes performances from the world's most prestigious and iconic venues (mainly across the United States and Europe), including **Carnegie Hall** in New York City, Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., and the White House; and **Royal Festival Hall** in London, for the queen.

Notably, Horowitz also have performed at universities—Woolsey Hall at Yale in 1966, Colden Center at Queens College in 1967, etc.

Horowitz's repertoire in these recordings showcases his affinity for certain composers, prominently featuring works of Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Scarlatti, and his favorite, **Rachmaninoff**. The collection, spanning from Classical to Romantic periods, is a testament to his versatility. Some pieces that were central to his concert programs:

- Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 and the Ballade No. 1, and various waltzes and études;

- Rachmaninoff's Piano Sonata No. 2 of course;
- Schumann's Kinderszenen, particularly the famous "Träumerei," along with Franz Liszt's "Mephisto Waltz No. 1" and "Années de Pèlerinage." featured frequently in encores.

The box set serves as a significant archival release, preserving Horowitz’s interpretations of these masterpieces, many of which had not been commercially available until this collection's release in 2015.

## And btw, Apple music classical always writes the best bio for the artists.

> With a liquid touch and extraordinary attention to detail, Vladimir Horowitz is widely admired for his white-hot interpretations of Liszt, Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, among others. Born in 1903 in Kiev, Horowitz fled the then-Russian city in the wake of the 1917 Revolution. After a successful stint giving concerts in Europe, the pianist made his debut at Carnegie Hall in 1928, settling in the U.S. with wife Wanda Toscanini, daughter of conductor Arturo Toscanini. Comprising a major part of Horowitz's legacy are the numerous virtuosic transcriptions (imaginative reworkings of well-known pieces) he composed, such as the 1945 arrangement of Sousa's The Stars and Stripes Forever, which he created to mark the Allied victory in World War II—and his U.S. citizenship. Horowitz's fiendishly difficult transcriptions regularly feature in today's recitals and recordings: Lang Lang often performs the historic pianist's version of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 15 (Ràkòczy March, featured on 2011's Liszt – My Piano Hero) and Yuja Wang plays Horowitz's Variations on a Theme from Bizet's “Carmen” on her 2012 album, Fantasia. Horowitz died in 1989 and is buried in the Toscanini family mausoleum in Milan.
