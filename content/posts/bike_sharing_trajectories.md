Bike sharing is a great topic, it's green and has lots of data. A relevant study:

> (shortened abstract) This paper presents a data-driven framework analyzing bike-sharing trips in Shanghai, the world's largest bike-share city. It integrates multiple data sources—transport networks, road characteristics, and urban land use—to study short-trip mobility patterns. Findings highlight usage trends, trip distribution, and route choice factors, offering insights for city planning, bike-sharing operations, and sustainable transportation development.

### Bike-Sharing Market & Consumer Choices

Bike rentals typically work in two ways: **monthly passes** or **pay-per-ride**. The three dominant companies are **MeiTuan Bike, HelloBike (Alipay), and DiDi Bike**.

How do consumers choose? Key factors include **bike availability, quality, and pricing**. However, bike-sharing platforms exhibit complex **network effects**—not always straightforward. For example, as **MeiTuan's demand grows**, more bikes are deployed, improving availability and convenience. But with more users, **maintenance costs rise**, potentially degrading service quality. This creates a **double-edged network effect**—expansion enhances accessibility but can also reduce user experience.

Let's simplify, say, companies set pricing strategies while considering:

- **User switching friction** (how easy it is to switch to a competitor)
- **Network effects** (how demand influences service quality)

The market equilibrium—shaped by pricing, competition, and user behavior—makes bike-sharing a fascinating case study in urban mobility economics, theoretically.
