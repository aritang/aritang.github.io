**La Bayadère** is a classical ballet set in ancient India, telling a story rich in love, betrayal, and mystique. One of its iconic female characters is Gamzatti, the princess—a role often performed by the prima ballerina. Marianela Núñez’s portrayal of Gamzatti’s entrance—known as the "***Gamzatti Variation***"—perfectly embodies the princess’s pride and beauty.

While a coarse version of this performance can be found on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/Hmu5rHcXdJQ?si=6d5psVEW-Im8kFc1), ballet lovers seeking higher-resolution gems might find BiliBili a surprisingly rich trove of treasures. Thanks to its "liberal" approach to copyright, this platform often provides full performance video of a complete ballet in dazzling 4K clarity. (well it seems that, intellectual property protection sometimes dances to its own tune...)
