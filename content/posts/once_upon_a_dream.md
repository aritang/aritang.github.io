Ariana Grande graced the 2024 Met Gala not merely as a guest but as a spellbinding performer under the grandeur of the Met’s storied arches. Clothed in a sheer green gown by Maison Margiela, designed by John Galliano, Grande radiated an ethereal charm. The gown, a diaphanous masterpiece, clung to her like morning dew, catching the light in a cascade of shimmering greens that seemed to paint her in the colors of a waking forest.

The evening's performances began with the hauntingly beautiful "Once Upon a Dream," an homage to the night's theme, "Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion." Originally titled "An Unusual Prince/Once Upon a Dream" from Disney’s *Sleeping Beauty*, the song is a rich tapestry woven from Tchaikovsky's grand waltzes from the ballet suite of the same name.

Grande’s rendition was not just a performance but a reenactment of the iconic dance between Aurora and her prince, blending the regal elegance of ballet with the soulful touch of a waltz. Every movement was a brushstroke, painting a scene of serene escapism—dancing by a moonlit lake, enveloped by an ancient forest, whispering of romance and reverie.

Through Grande's voice, the lyrics of "Once Upon a Dream" echoed through the ornate halls, each note a thread in the intricate web of nostalgia and dreams. It was more than a song; it was a promise of a fairy tale reawakened in the hearts of all who listened:

> I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
> I know you, The gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
> And I know it's true, that visions are seldom all they seem
> But if I know you, I know what you'll do
> You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

In a night dedicated to reawakening beauty, Ariana Grande reminded everyone of the timeless allure of fairy tales, bringing to life the magic and majesty of a dream long cherished.
