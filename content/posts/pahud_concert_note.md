Flute shines brightest in chamber music — not that the ethereal flute solo in *Carmen Intermezzo* isn’t already fantastic — but orchestral solos are still somewhat constrained, where the flute serves as one beautiful component within a larger structure. Chamber music, on the other hand, gives the instrument the full freedom to express, flex, dance.

And Pahud elevates the entire performance with his charisma, precision, and deep musical understanding. If you ever get the chance, **don’t miss him live**. Whether it’s orchestral or chamber, it’s worth it. If nothing else, the fact that he’s involved usually signals that the program is something special.

Anyway — here are a few of my personal highlights from the concert:

- **Bach's Flute Partita in A Minor (BWV 1013)**

    Bach is definitely endorsed by heaven. And Pahud’s sound is clean and articulated to portray that. The concert is no-picture-video but the following recording of Pahud is roughly the same:

- **Beethoven: Serenade in D Major (Op. 25).** Beethoven's flute pieces, written during his early years, are always a joy. 

    This is a piece that feels like sunshine and conversation. And Pahud really is good at delivering a conversation with the audience.

- **Oriental Pieces.** Listen to II. Jade. This is a modern French piece, imagine of French composer for Chinese flutes — and I'd say, the image is precise. Pahud’s playing here blends Western finesse with the fluidity of traditional Chinese flutes — charming, nimble, expressive.

- A classic, clean and stylish Mozart is super helpful for a great Chamber music program of course: **Flute Quartet K. 285**.

    *Fun aside*: Mozart didn’t hate the flute — despite the popular myth. He just resented that his flute commission went unpaid because *he* procrastinated.

- Encore: Piazzolla, *Fuga y Misterio* from *María de Buenos Aires* (Turns out it’s from a tango opera?)

    The arrangement was lush and sultry — a perfect closer.

    Also — Piazzolla’s *Histoire du Tango* (especially Movement II, “Café 1930”) is a favorite of mine. If you haven’t heard the flute + guitar version, add it to your list.
