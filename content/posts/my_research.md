As I prepare on an enlightening journey to the National Conference on Supply Chain and Operation Management (ISCOM 2023) and the Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2023) in Shanghai, I can't help but feel a buzz of excitement. These conferences are not just events but gateways to new ideas, connections, and insights, and they're conveniently located for my easy commute anyway.

#### The Art of Conference Attendance: More Than Just Talks

ISCOM, for me, is the appetizer in this intellectual feast, a chance to warm up and socialize with like-minded professionals. In contrast, WINE is the main course, a veritable treasure trove aligned perfectly with my interests. Keep an eye out for my upcoming updates for fresh takes and insights from these events!

#### GRWM for a Week of Discovery

Imagine a week-long marathon of talks, from Saturday to Thursday – a test of endurance and intellectual curiosity. The first challenge is navigating the labyrinth of parallel tracks to find those gems that resonate most with my interests and professional growth.

But the real adventure begins in the corridors and dining areas during tea breaks and lunches. It's here that the theories from "Romancing the Room" and insights from "Misunderstandings and False Beliefs in Communication" come to life. Socializing at these events is a delicate dance of cheap talk and meaningful conversation, a blend of light-hearted banter and substantive dialogue. It's about captivating interest and creating pleasant, memorable exchanges while also remembering everyone's name – a feat I'm determined to master this time around!

Yet despite all the strategies, the most important essence is alway authenticity. One cannot fake genuine intention of kindness, curiosity and devotion to research. Such kind of people possess speical traits and are usually mutually attractive - at least to me they're easily identifiable.

#### A Cheeky Bonus: Shopping Spree

And, as a delightful side note, these conferences provide the perfect excuse to indulge in some retail therapy. Shopping for new clothes for the event – as if I needed more – adds a playful and enjoyable element to the preparation process. It's the cherry on top of what promises to be an enriching and engaging experience.
