> From a classical perspective, taking a breath in the middle of the word ‘over’ in her first line seems like an unusual technical choice. But, after accepting that this is a pop-R&B take on Arlen’s classic song of hope, filled with Grande’s personal stylings, it makes more musical sense.

Ariana Grande's vocal position switch—that she shifts between using head voice and mix and full belt registers—there are always skilfully and smoothly delivered. ***She's an awesome vocalist.*** But alright—here’s the real talk version:

> Ariana Grande takes a breath in the middle of the word *"over"* in the first line, which would be a weird and technically poor choice in classical singing. But since this is a pop-R&B version of the song, and not a traditional rendition, it makes more sense in context.

> Like in many of her performances, she doesn’t have the breath control of a classical singer, but she’s not just running out of air randomly. Instead, she uses those breaths as part of her style, adding emotion and texture rather than strictly following traditional technique.
