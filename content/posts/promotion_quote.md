A sign of growth: one starts to understand people or fictional characters that used to despise. Now that *The Devil Wears Prada* makes much more sense to me. This quote explains it all:

> **Andrea:** My personal life is falling apart.
>
> **Nigel:** That's what happens when you start doing well at work. **Let me know when your entire life goes up in smoke, means it's time for a promotion.**
