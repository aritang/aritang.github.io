This archive [*Blog Posts About Classical Music Collection*](/posts/updated_classical_music_series/) started as a way just to keep track of blogs — but it has slowly become a personal map of musical obsessions and opinions. It kinda traces how I’ve moved through time in my life.

Technically, I should have relied on tags instead of manually collecting every post, but revisiting my six‑month music library while copy‑and‑pasting turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. Seems like, I’ve been obsessed with Tchaikovsky and Chopin lately, and that passion naturally spilled over into other Romantic-era composers—hence the flood of piano and ballet works.

I’ll keep adding to this as I go—more for myself than anything, but if it helps someone find their next favorite piece, all the better.
