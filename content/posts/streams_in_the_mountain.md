I spent the day hiking up a valley, tracing a stream until it cascaded into a waterfall. The water was glass-clear, tumbling over stones exactly as the ancient poem describes:

**“清泉石上流”**
*(Over mossy stones, the crystal stream glides.)*

The beauty was undeniable—but as a metropolitan indoor person, I’ll admit the *aesthetic* was more rewarding than the *activity*.
