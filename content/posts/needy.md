***Thank U, Next*** got two seats out of the top-10 list. One is [imagine](/posts/imagine/), the other is **needy**.

I do hate overly simple songs: cloying melodies consisted of banal, unimaginative motifs  and too-obvious intentions are absolutely unforgivable. Referring the words of a professor's architecture appreciation course I've taken two years ago, "sometimes overly obvious 'signs' or too straightforward expressions, despite appealing, are degrading for art."

BUT ---- despite having shallow melodies (that one can literally anticipate the whole song after hearing the first few bars), needy sits on top of the list being simplicitly expressive and truthful. The song is about insecuritiesâ€“of one's attachment, obsession and struggle in a relationshipâ€“that Ariana Grande sang out in subjective tense, right out of the lyrics:

> [Pre-Chorus]
>
> Iâ€™ma scream and shout for what I love
>
> Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
>
> I admit that Iâ€™m a lil' messed up
>
> But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
>
> I'm obsessive and I love too hard
>
> Good at overthinking with my heart
>
> How you even think it got this far, this far?

> [Chorus]
>
> And I can be needy, way too damn needy
>
> I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
>
> I can be needy, so hard to please me
>
> I know it feels so good to be needed

Take a moment to appreciate the authenticity. Nowadays when the general environment has influenced most to be so fake and phoney, opening up to this extent as admitting one's needy-ness is almost social suicide. It's as if Ariana Grande is presenting herself as an open book, to be emphasized by, and for her fans.

**The music makes one feel seen.** And this is, if not the only, surely the most efficient working formula for any track to chart as crazy. Fans are no longer looking forward to being awed by musical spectacles. Rather, the virtual space of empathized feelings that connects souls eventually ends up in creating a cyber carnival. Stream queen Ari nailed it. Let's toast herðŸ¥‚.
