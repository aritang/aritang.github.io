If you’ve never used **Dianping**, think Yelp—but shinier, angrier, and far more dominating with the fate of restaurants in China. It’s *the* platform people turn to when deciding whether some ¥68 hotpot buffet would be a delicious meal or a strict no-no.

Naturally, the platform holds **immense** power. A single low rating can haunt a restaurant’s prospects worse than bad feng shui. Restaurants, understandably, get furious when they feel wronged—especially by vague, hostile, or outright malicious reviews. In response, they often *appeal* to Dianping, asking for these ratings to be reconsidered and (hopefully) wiped.

Here’s where it gets interesting: Dianping doesn’t rule unilaterally. Instead, they crowdsource judgment through something very much like Twitter’s **Community Notes** system.

When a rating is appealed, the platform:

1. Notifies both the restaurant and the reviewer to submit “evidence.”
2. Pushes the case, along with all supplementary notes, to a pool of **community judges**.
3. The judges then vote whether the rating is "**appropriate**" or "**inappropriate**."

Let's get nerdy and think about it mathematically.

Suppose there’s some unknown true "appropriateness" of a disputed rating, call it  
$$
r\in [0,1].
$$
Each community judge gives a noisy binary signal  
$$
s_i \in \{0, 1\},
$$
where
$$
\Pr[s_i = 1\mid r] = q(r)
$$
and naturally, $q(r)$ should be increasing in $r$ — meaning, the more appropriate the rating actually is, the more likely a random judge will vote “appropriate.”

From Dianping’s perspective, the job is to use a limited number of judge votes to best infer $r$, reaching a sufficiently high-confidence decision. It’s a classic **Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB)** setup... but: not only does the platform care about precision (i.e., minimizing false positives/negatives), but also **speed**. A slow verdict is bad for everyone—reviewers, restaurants, and diners alike.

In practice, you can already see this system evolving: more controversial ratings (i.e., ones that get split opinions among early judges) seem to get **more judges assigned** to them.

If you squint at it, this could be a fantastic **Contextual-RMAB problem** in operations management:
- Different ratings have different underlying controversy levels.
- Judges have different (unknown) reliabilities.
- Time pressure matters.

Lmk if you want to work on it with me. 

Meanwhile, for the rest of us, it's a reminder that even deciding whether a ¥19 wonton shop deserves a 2-star review has quietly turned into a probabilistic social experiment—with algorithms lurking in the background, judging our judges.
