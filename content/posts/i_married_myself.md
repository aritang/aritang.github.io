The TV series Etoile (2025) ends with a solo modern ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, to the music by Sparks, singing, "**I married myself, I'm very happy together. Candlelight, dinner's home, lovely times...**"

Seems a bit absurd a first sight, but It's a very very beatiful and deep concept explored here. "To marry oneself means to fully accept one’s own flaws, either by looking past them or taking the necessary steps to improve. No wonder a cloud of bliss saturates the song. Not every marriage is as healthy as the joyous union of self meeting self. And "*this time, it's gonna last forever*." 'Til death do we part, indeed."

Here's a snippet of Wheeldon's choreography performed by Constance Devernay-Laurence (the dancer) and Lou de Laâge (the actor), from the last episode of Etoile:
