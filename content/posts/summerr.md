Summer holds a cherished place in the hearts of Chinese people. It's a time of graduation, moving onto new chapters in life, accompanied by the humming of hot air and cool breezes, and the taste of iced watermelon. My heart skips a beat whenever I recall those memories—the midnight walks along the Thames in London, driving along Big Sur, or even just buying silly cat dolls at home with my dad.

Perhaps it's the academic year's structure that instills in us the habit of treating summer as a break, a tradition we carry into adulthood. Or maybe it's the delightful weather that lifts our spirits and reduces friction, enabling us to take a step forward. ***Call Me By Your Name*** unfolds in summer—a season that, more than coincidentally, often sets the stage for love stories, when the buzz of insects and the rustle of vibrant green leaves in the breeze set the perfect backdrop. Reminiscing, yet another summer is on the horizon, and I'm curious to see what it will bring.
