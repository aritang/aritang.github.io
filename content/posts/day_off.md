My favourite so far, for Ariana Grande's new album **eternal sunshine** is its *intro (end of the world)*. Every intro of Ariana Grande's album is insanely beautiful. She tends to use softer instruments (especially strings) to company her voice, which leave space for her vocal showcase. For example, the intro of My Everything is almost as dreamy as falling into the galaxy's star dusts. Not to mention the iconic 30-seconds solo acapella *raindrops (an angel cried)* of Sweetener.

The intro of **eternal sunshine** is full of questions straight to the heart: "how do i know if i'm in the right relationship/aren't you really suppose to know that shit?", "if the sun refuse to shine, baby will i still be your lover? would you want me there?"

The inflection and musicality in Ariana Grande's vocal render the track exceptionally enjoyable to listen to. And the emotion emphasize with myself as well:

> then i had this interaction i've been thinking 'bout for like five weeks
>
> wonder if he's thinking 'bout it too and smiling
>
> wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspiring me
>
> wonder if he's judging me like i am right now

Queen.
