people in academia are generally too good at procrastinating. doing things at last minute isn't entirely wrong. like, some job scheduling algorithms do look like they are procrastinating. plus there is the infamous ***structured procrastination***...

but at the end of the day, procrastination makes one think inefficiently in a rush, raise anxiety level and occasionally, blow up deadlines. 

so here's an effort of trying to battle my procrastinating tendency during bloggings:

i start a [bulletin](/procrastination_bulletin/) of every ideas that i've **initiated yet unfinished**, with their starting time.

> i will **NOT** delete any unfinished ideas (instead, they will be marked 'discarded'), nor would i make untruthful modification to the time. 
>
> i'll replace every idea with their finished blog. 

wish me luck!
