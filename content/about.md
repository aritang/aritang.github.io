Hi, this is Ariana. Welcome to my corner of the internet!

{{<figure align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aritang/aritangPictures/main/static/definition/zoom_screenshot.jpeg" caption="Download My CV [***here***](/files/ariana_tang_cv.pdf). If there is anything I can help, my email is `ariana_tang AT uchicago DOT edu`.">}}

## research

I am a first-year PhD at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, where I was co-advised by Prof. Pinyan Lu and by Prof. Hu Fu. During then, I was very lucky to be advised by and collaborating with [Prof. Ryan Shi](https://ryanzshi.github.io) and [Prof. Modibo Camara](https://mkcamara.github.io).

My research focuses on market design. I'm also interested in EconCS in general.

> **I believe that game theorists [also] need to be sensitive to cultural and psychological factors to better understand the incentives and constraints that people face.**

> — Professor Alvin Roth

Acute perception, mathematical skills and a deep sense of empathy embodies the essence of a modern economist, and is what I'm committed to becoming. And here are the papers:

> Price Stability and Improved Buyer Utility with Presentation Design: A Theoretical Study of the Amazon Buy Box. Ophir Friedler, Hu Fu, Anna Karlin, **Ariana Tang**. Accepted at The Web Conference 2025. [paper pdf](/files/Friedler_et_al_PriceStabilityPresentation-WWW.pdf) [poster](/files/bottle_of_bubbles-poster.pdf)

## art

I'm really interested in classical music and ballet. As the blog updates on a daily basis, while I usually prioritize academic posts over musical ones — when things get hectic, I turn to music. So if you spot a flurry of music posts, that’s me in full-on busy mode.

My favorite composer is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893), whom my cat is named after. My favourite piece is Mendelssohn's *A Midsummer Night's Dream* — specifically, the *Overture* (Op. 21) and the *Scherzo* (No. 1 Op. 61). I also play the flute.

## life

I am greatly inspired by Ariana Grande's album ***Sweetener***:

> **It's kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone's life or somebody else brings light to your life, like, sweetening the situation.**
