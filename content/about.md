## research

I am a first-year PhD at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, where I was co-advised by Prof. Pinyan Lu and by Prof. Hu Fu. During then, I was very lucky to be advised by and collaborating with [Prof. Ryan Shi](https://ryanzshi.github.io) and [Prof. Modibo Camara](https://mkcamara.github.io).

My research focuses on market design. I'm also interested in EconCS in general.

Acute perception, mathematical skills and a deep sense of empathy embodies the essence of a modern economist, and is what I'm committed to becoming. And here are the papers:

> Price Stability and Improved Buyer Utility with Presentation Design: A Theoretical Study of the Amazon Buy Box. Ophir Friedler, Hu Fu, Anna Karlin, **Ariana Tang**. Accepted at The Web Conference 2025. [paper pdf](/files/Friedler_et_al_PriceStabilityPresentation-WWW.pdf) [poster](/files/bottle_of_bubbles-poster.pdf)

### "a blog about my research, art and life"

This blog is a gateway into my world of research, art, and everyday thoughts. I started it because Professor Alvin Roth's amazing market design blog.

There are a lot of fun stuff in the blog. Try search for any keywords you found interesting and I have probably wrote something abot it. Or, please feel free to contact me for the interesting topic on your mind :)

## art

I'm really interested in classical music and ballet. As the blog updates on a daily basis, while I usually prioritize academic posts over musical ones — **when things get hectic, I turn to music**. So if you spot a flurry of music posts, that’s me in full-on busy mode.

My favorite composer is **Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky** (1840-1893), whom my cat is named after. My favourite piece is **Mendelssohn's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*** — specifically, the *Overture* (Op. 21) and the *Scherzo* (No. 1 Op. 61).

## life

I love Ariana Grande and the concept that her ***Sweetener*** album delivers:

> **it's kind of about bringing light to a situation or to someone's life or somebody else brings life to your life. sweetening the situation.**
